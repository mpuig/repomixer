# ADK with Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol

With Agent Development Kit (ADK), you can build complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact using [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/)! This section provides a comprehensive guide to building powerful multi-agent systems where agents can communicate and collaborate securely and efficiently.

Navigate through the guides below to learn about ADK's A2A capabilities:

  **[Introduction to A2A](./intro.md)**

  Start here to learn the fundamentals of A2A by building a multi-agent system with a root agent, a local sub-agent, and a remote A2A agent.

# Introduction to A2A

As you build more complex agentic systems, you will find that a single agent
is often not enough. You will want to create specialized agents that can
collaborate to solve a problem. The [**Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**](https://a2a-protocol.org) is the
standard that allows these agents to communicate with each other.

## When to Use A2A vs. Local Sub-Agents

- **Local Sub-Agents:** These are agents that run *within the same application
  process* as your main agent. They are like internal modules or libraries, used
  to organize your code into logical, reusable components. Communication between
  a main agent and its local sub-agents is very fast because it happens
  directly in memory, without network overhead.

- **Remote Agents (A2A):** These are independent agents that run as separate
  services, communicating over a network. A2A defines the standard protocol
  for this communication.

Consider using **A2A** when:

- The agent you need to talk to is a **separate, standalone service** (e.g., a
  specialized financial modeling agent).
- The agent is maintained by a **different team or organization**.
- You need to connect agents written in **different programming languages or
  agent frameworks**.
- You want to enforce a **strong, formal contract** (the A2A protocol) between
  your system's components.

### When to Use A2A: Concrete Examples

- **Integrating with a Third-Party Service:** Your main agent needs to get
  real-time stock prices from an external financial data provider. This
  provider exposes its data through an A2A-compatible agent.
- **Microservices Architecture:** You have a large system broken down into
  smaller, independent services (e.g., an Order Processing Agent, an Inventory
  Management Agent, a Shipping Agent). A2A is ideal for these services to
  communicate with each other across network boundaries.
- **Cross-Language Communication:** Your core business logic is in a Python
  agent, but you have a legacy system or a specialized component written in Java
  that you want to integrate as an agent. A2A provides the standardized
  communication layer.
- **Formal API Enforcement:** You are building a platform where different teams
  contribute agents, and you need a strict contract for how these agents
  interact to ensure compatibility and stability.

### When NOT to Use A2A: Concrete Examples (Prefer Local Sub-Agents)

- **Internal Code Organization:** You are breaking down a complex task within a
  single agent into smaller, manageable functions or modules (e.g., a
  `DataValidator` sub-agent that cleans input data before processing). These are
  best handled as local sub-agents for performance and simplicity.
- **Performance-Critical Internal Operations:** A sub-agent is responsible for a
  high-frequency, low-latency operation that is tightly coupled with the main
  agent's execution (e.g., a `RealTimeAnalytics` sub-agent that processes data
  streams within the same application).
- **Shared Memory/Context:** When sub-agents need direct access to the main
  agent's internal state or shared memory for efficiency, A2A's network
  overhead and serialization/deserialization would be counterproductive.
- **Simple Helper Functions:** For small, reusable pieces of logic that don't
  require independent deployment or complex state management, a simple function
  or class within the same agent is more appropriate than a separate A2A agent.

## The A2A Workflow in ADK: A Simplified View

Agent Development Kit (ADK) simplifies the process of building and connecting
agents using the A2A protocol. Here's a straightforward breakdown of how it
works:

1. **Making an Agent Accessible (Exposing):** You start with an existing ADK
    agent that you want other agents to be able to interact with. The ADK
    provides a simple way to "expose" this agent, turning it into an
    **A2AServer**. This server acts as a public interface, allowing other agents
    to send requests to your agent over a network. Think of it like setting up a
    web server for your agent.

2. **Connecting to an Accessible Agent (Consuming):** In a separate agent
    (which could be running on the same machine or a different one), you'll use
    a special ADK component called `RemoteA2aAgent`. This `RemoteA2aAgent` acts
    as a client that knows how to communicate with the **A2AServer** you
    exposed earlier. It handles all the complexities of network communication,
    authentication, and data formatting behind the scenes.

From your perspective as a developer, once you've set up this connection,
interacting with the remote agent feels just like interacting with a local tool
or function. The ADK abstracts away the network layer, making distributed agent
systems as easy to work with as local ones.

## Visualizing the A2A Workflow

To further clarify the A2A workflow, let's look at the "before and after" for
both exposing and consuming agents, and then the combined system.

### Exposing an Agent

**Before Exposing:**
Your agent code runs as a standalone component, but in this scenario, you want
to expose it so that other remote agents can interact with your agent.

```text
+-------------------+
| Your Agent Code   |
|   (Standalone)    |
+-------------------+
```

**After Exposing:**
Your agent code is integrated with an `A2AServer` (an ADK component), making it
accessible over a network to other remote agents.

```text
+-----------------+
|   A2A Server    |
| (ADK Component) |<--------+
+-----------------+         |
        |                   |
        v                   |
+-------------------+       |
| Your Agent Code   |       |
| (Now Accessible)  |       |
+-------------------+       |
                            |
                            | (Network Communication)
                            v
+-----------------------------+
|       Remote Agent(s)       |
|    (Can now communicate)    |
+-----------------------------+
```

### Consuming an Agent

**Before Consuming:**
Your agent (referred to as the "Root Agent" in this context) is the application
you are developing that needs to interact with a remote agent. Before
consuming, it lacks the direct mechanism to do so.

```text
+----------------------+         +-------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Root Agent      |         |                        Remote Agent                         |
| (Your existing code) |         | (External Service that you want your Root Agent to talk to) |
+----------------------+         +-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**After Consuming:**
Your Root Agent uses a `RemoteA2aAgent` (an ADK component that acts as a
client-side proxy for the remote agent) to establish communication with the
remote agent.

```text
+----------------------+         +-----------------------------------+
|      Root Agent      |         |         RemoteA2aAgent            |
| (Your existing code) |<------->|         (ADK Client Proxy)        |
+----------------------+         |                                   |
                                 |  +-----------------------------+  |
                                 |  |         Remote Agent        |  |
                                 |  |      (External Service)     |  |
                                 |  +-----------------------------+  |
                                 +-----------------------------------+
      (Now talks to remote agent via RemoteA2aAgent)
```

### Final System (Combined View)

This diagram shows how the consuming and exposing parts connect to form a
complete A2A system.

                                               +-------------------+
```

## Concrete Use Case: Customer Service and Product Catalog Agents

Let's consider a practical example: a **Customer Service Agent** that needs to
retrieve product information from a separate **Product Catalog Agent**.

### Before A2A

Initially, your Customer Service Agent might not have a direct, standardized
way to query the Product Catalog Agent, especially if it's a separate service
or managed by a different team.

```text
+-------------------------+         +--------------------------+
| Customer Service Agent  |         |  Product Catalog Agent   |
| (Needs Product Info)    |         | (Contains Product Data)  |
+-------------------------+         +--------------------------+
      (No direct, standardized communication)
```

### After A2A

By using the A2A Protocol, the Product Catalog Agent can expose its
functionality as an A2A service. Your Customer Service Agent can then easily
consume this service using ADK's `RemoteA2aAgent`.

```text
+-------------------------+         +-----------------------------------+
| Customer Service Agent  |         |         RemoteA2aAgent            |
| (Your Root Agent)       |<------->|         (ADK Client Proxy)        |
+-------------------------+         |                                   |
                                    |  +-----------------------------+  |
                                    |  |     Product Catalog Agent   |  |
                                    |  |      (External Service)     |  |
                                    |  +-----------------------------+  |
                                    +-----------------------------------+
                                                 |
                                                 | (Network Communication)
                                                 v
                                               +-----------------+
                                               |   A2A Server    |
                                               | (ADK Component) |
                                               +-----------------+
                                                       |
                                                       v
                                               +------------------------+
                                               | Product Catalog Agent  |
                                               | (Exposed Service)      |
                                               +------------------------+
```

In this setup, first, the Product Catalog Agent needs to be exposed via an A2A
Server. Then, the Customer Service Agent can simply call methods on the
`RemoteA2aAgent` as if it were a tool, and the ADK handles all the underlying
communication to the Product Catalog Agent. This allows for clear separation of
concerns and easy integration of specialized agents.

Now that you understand the "why" of A2A, let's dive into the "how."

# Quickstart: Consuming a remote agent via A2A

This quickstart covers the most common starting point for any developer: **"There is a remote agent, how do I let my ADK agent use it via A2A?"**. This is crucial for building complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact.

## Overview

This sample demonstrates the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** architecture in the Agent Development Kit (ADK), showcasing how multiple agents can work together to handle complex tasks. The sample implements an agent that can roll dice and check if numbers are prime.

```text
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌────────────────────┐
│   Root Agent    │───▶│   Roll Agent     │    │   Remote Prime     │
│  (Local)        │    │   (Local)        │    │   Agent            │
│                 │    │                  │    │  (localhost:8001)  │
│                 │───▶│                  │◀───│                    │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └────────────────────┘
```

The A2A Basic sample consists of:

- **Root Agent** (`root_agent`): The main orchestrator that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents
- **Roll Agent** (`roll_agent`): A local sub-agent that handles dice rolling operations
- **Prime Agent** (`prime_agent`): A remote A2A agent that checks if numbers are prime, this agent is running on a separate A2A server

## Exposing Your Agent with the ADK Server

  The ADK comes with a built-in CLI command, `adk api_server --a2a` to expose your agent using the A2A protocol.

  In the `a2a_basic` example, you will first need to expose the `check_prime_agent` via an A2A server, so that the local root agent can use it.

### 1. Getting the Sample Code { #getting-the-sample-code }

First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install google-adk[a2a]
```

You can clone and navigate to the [**`a2a_basic`** sample](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/a2a_basic) here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-python.git
```

As you'll see, the folder structure is as follows:

```text
a2a_basic/
├── remote_a2a/
│   └── check_prime_agent/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── agent.json
│       └── agent.py
├── README.md
├── __init__.py
└── agent.py # local root agent
```

#### Main Agent (`a2a_basic/agent.py`)

- **`roll_die(sides: int)`**: Function tool for rolling dice
- **`roll_agent`**: Local agent specialized in dice rolling
- **`prime_agent`**: Remote A2A agent configuration
- **`root_agent`**: Main orchestrator with delegation logic

#### Remote Prime Agent (`a2a_basic/remote_a2a/check_prime_agent/`)

- **`agent.py`**: Implementation of the prime checking service
- **`agent.json`**: Agent card of the A2A agent
- **`check_prime(nums: list[int])`**: Prime number checking algorithm

### 2. Start the Remote Prime Agent server { #start-the-remote-prime-agent-server }

To show how your ADK agent can consume a remote agent via A2A, you'll first need to start a remote agent server, which will host the prime agent (under `check_prime_agent`).

```bash
# Start the remote a2a server that serves the check_prime_agent on port 8001
adk api_server --a2a --port 8001 contributing/samples/a2a_basic/remote_a2a
```

??? note "Adding logging for debugging with `--log_level debug`"
    To enable debug-level logging, you can add `--log_level debug` to your `adk api_server`, as in:
    ```bash
    adk api_server --a2a --port 8001 contributing/samples/a2a_basic/remote_a2a --log_level debug
    ```
    This will give richer logs for you to inspect when testing your agents.

??? note "Why use port 8001?"
    In this quickstart, when testing locally, your agents will be using localhost, so the `port` for the A2A server for the exposed agent (the remote, prime agent) must be different from the consuming agent's port. The default port for `adk web` where you will interact with the consuming agent is `8000`, which is why the A2A server is created using a separate port, `8001`.

Once executed, you should see something like:

``` shell
INFO:     Started server process [56558]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
  
### 3. Look out for the required agent card (`agent-card.json`) of the remote agent { #look-out-for-the-required-agent-card-agent-json-of-the-remote-agent }

A2A Protocol requires that each agent must have an agent card that describes what it does.

If someone else has already built the remote A2A agent that you are looking to consume in your agent, then you should confirm that they have an agent card (`agent-card.json`).

In the sample, the `check_prime_agent` already has an agent card provided:

```json title="a2a_basic/remote_a2a/check_prime_agent/agent-card.json"

{
  "capabilities": {},
  "defaultInputModes": ["text/plain"],
  "defaultOutputModes": ["application/json"],
  "description": "An agent specialized in checking whether numbers are prime. It can efficiently determine the primality of individual numbers or lists of numbers.",
  "name": "check_prime_agent",
  "skills": [
    {
      "id": "prime_checking",
      "name": "Prime Number Checking",
      "description": "Check if numbers in a list are prime using efficient mathematical algorithms",
      "tags": ["mathematical", "computation", "prime", "numbers"]
    }
  ],
  "url": "http://localhost:8001/a2a/check_prime_agent",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

??? note "More info on agent cards in ADK"

    In ADK, you can use a `to_a2a(root_agent)` wrapper which automatically generates an agent card for you. If you're interested in learning more about how to expose your existing agent so others can use it, then please look at the [A2A Quickstart (Exposing)](quickstart-exposing.md) tutorial. 

### 4. Run the Main (Consuming) Agent { #run-the-main-consuming-agent }

  ```bash
  # In a separate terminal, run the adk web server
  adk web contributing/samples/
  ```

#### How it works

The main agent uses the `RemoteA2aAgent()` function to consume the remote agent (`prime_agent` in our example). As you can see below, `RemoteA2aAgent()` requires the `name`, `description`, and the URL of the `agent_card`.

```python title="a2a_basic/agent.py"
<...code truncated...>

from google.adk.agents.remote_a2a_agent import AGENT_CARD_WELL_KNOWN_PATH
from google.adk.agents.remote_a2a_agent import RemoteA2aAgent

prime_agent = RemoteA2aAgent(
    name="prime_agent",
    description="Agent that handles checking if numbers are prime.",
    agent_card=(
        f"http://localhost:8001/a2a/check_prime_agent{AGENT_CARD_WELL_KNOWN_PATH}"
    ),
)

<...code truncated>
```

Then, you can simply use the `RemoteA2aAgent` in your agent. In this case, `prime_agent` is used as one of the sub-agents in the `root_agent` below:

```python title="a2a_basic/agent.py"
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.genai import types

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    name="root_agent",
    instruction="""
      <You are a helpful assistant that can roll dice and check if numbers are prime.
      You delegate rolling dice tasks to the roll_agent and prime checking tasks to the prime_agent.
      Follow these steps:
      1. If the user asks to roll a die, delegate to the roll_agent.
      2. If the user asks to check primes, delegate to the prime_agent.
      3. If the user asks to roll a die and then check if the result is prime, call roll_agent first, then pass the result to prime_agent.
      Always clarify the results before proceeding.>
    """,
    global_instruction=(
        "You are DicePrimeBot, ready to roll dice and check prime numbers."
    ),
    sub_agents=[roll_agent, prime_agent],
    tools=[example_tool],
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        safety_settings=[
            types.SafetySetting(  # avoid false alarm about rolling dice.
                category=types.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT,
                threshold=types.HarmBlockThreshold.OFF,
            ),
        ]
    ),
)
```

## Example Interactions

Once both your main and remote agents are running, you can interact with the root agent to see how it calls the remote agent via A2A:

**Simple Dice Rolling:**
This interaction uses a local agent, the Roll Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 6-sided die
Bot: I rolled a 4 for you.
```

**Prime Number Checking:**

This interaction uses a remote agent via A2A, the Prime Agent:

```text
User: Is 7 a prime number?
Bot: Yes, 7 is a prime number.
```

**Combined Operations:**

This interaction uses both the local Roll Agent and the remote Prime Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 10-sided die and check if it's prime
Bot: I rolled an 8 for you.
Bot: 8 is not a prime number.
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have created an agent that's using a remote agent via an A2A server, the next step is to learn how to connect to it from another agent.

# Quickstart: Exposing a remote agent via A2A

This quickstart covers the most common starting point for any developer: **"I have an agent. How do I expose it so that other agents can use my agent via A2A?"**. This is crucial for building complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact.

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how you can easily expose an ADK agent so that it can be then consumed by another agent using the A2A Protocol.

There are two main ways to expose an ADK agent via A2A.

* **by using the `to_a2a(root_agent)` function**: use this function if you just want to convert an existing agent to work with A2A, and be able to expose it via a server through `uvicorn`, instead of `adk deploy api_server`. This means that you have tighter control over what you want to expose via `uvicorn` when you want to productionize your agent. Furthermore, the `to_a2a()` function auto-generates an agent card based on your agent code.
* **by creating your own agent card (`agent.json`) and hosting it using `adk api_server --a2a`**: There are two main benefits of using this approach. First, `adk api_server --a2a` works with `adk web`, making it easy to use, debug, and test your agent. Second, with `adk api_server`, you can specify a parent folder with multiple, separate agents. Those agents that have an agent card (`agent.json`), will automatically be usable via A2A by other agents through the same server. However, you will need to create your own agent cards. To create an agent card, you can follow the [A2A Python tutorial](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/tutorials/python/1-introduction/).

This quickstart will focus on `to_a2a()`, as it is the easiest way to expose your agent and will also autogenerate the agent card behind-the-scenes. If you'd like to use the `adk api_server` approach, you can see it being used in the [A2A Quickstart (Consuming) documentation](quickstart-consuming.md).

└────────────────┘
```

The sample consists of :

- **Remote Hello World Agent** (`remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`): This is the agent that you want to expose so that other agents can use it via A2A. It is an agent that handles dice rolling and prime number checking. It becomes exposed using the `to_a2a()` function and is served using `uvicorn`.
- **Root Agent** (`agent.py`): A simple agent that is just calling the remote Hello World agent.

## Exposing the Remote Agent with the `to_a2a(root_agent)` function

You can take an existing agent built using ADK and make it A2A-compatible by simply wrapping it using the `to_a2a()` function. For example, if you have an agent like the following defined in `root_agent`:

```python
# Your agent code here
root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='hello_world_agent',
    
    <...your agent code...>
)
```

Then you can make it A2A-compatible simply by using `to_a2a(root_agent)`:

```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a

# Make your agent A2A-compatible
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001)
```

The `to_a2a()` function will even auto-generate an agent card in-memory behind-the-scenes by [extracting skills, capabilities, and metadata from the ADK agent](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/a2a/utils/agent_card_builder.py), so that the well-known agent card is made available when the agent endpoint is served using `uvicorn`.

You can also provide your own agent card by using the `agent_card` parameter. The value can be an `AgentCard` object or a path to an agent card JSON file.

**Example with an `AgentCard` object:**
```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a
from a2a.types import AgentCard

# Define A2A agent card
my_agent_card = AgentCard(
    "name": "file_agent",
    "url": "http://example.com",
    "description": "Test agent from file",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": {},
    "skills": [],
    "defaultInputModes": ["text/plain"],
    "defaultOutputModes": ["text/plain"],
    "supportsAuthenticatedExtendedCard": False,
)
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001, agent_card=my_agent_card)
```

**Example with a path to a JSON file:**
```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a

# Load A2A agent card from a file
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001, agent_card="/path/to/your/agent-card.json")
```

Now let's dive into the sample code.

### 1. Getting the Sample Code { #getting-the-sample-code }

First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install google-adk[a2a]
```

You can clone and navigate to the [**a2a_root** sample](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/a2a_root) here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-python.git
```

As you'll see, the folder structure is as follows:

```text
a2a_root/
├── remote_a2a/
│   └── hello_world/    
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── agent.py    # Remote Hello World Agent
├── README.md
└── agent.py            # Root agent
```

#### Root Agent (`a2a_root/agent.py`)

- **`root_agent`**: A `RemoteA2aAgent` that connects to the remote A2A service
- **Agent Card URL**: Points to the well-known agent card endpoint on the remote server

#### Remote Hello World Agent (`a2a_root/remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`)

- **`roll_die(sides: int)`**: Function tool for rolling dice with state management
- **`check_prime(nums: list[int])`**: Async function for prime number checking
- **`root_agent`**: The main agent with comprehensive instructions
- **`a2a_app`**: The A2A application created using `to_a2a()` utility

### 2. Start the Remote A2A Agent server { #start-the-remote-a2a-agent-server }

You can now start the remote agent server, which will host the `a2a_app` within the hello_world agent:

```bash
# Ensure current working directory is adk-python/
# Start the remote agent using uvicorn
uvicorn contributing.samples.a2a_root.remote_a2a.hello_world.agent:a2a_app --host localhost --port 8001
```

??? note "Why use port 8001?"
    In this quickstart, when testing locally, your agents will be using localhost, so the `port` for the A2A server for the exposed agent (the remote, prime agent) must be different from the consuming agent's port. The default port for `adk web` where you will interact with the consuming agent is `8000`, which is why the A2A server is created using a separate port, `8001`.

Once executed, you should see something like:

```shell
INFO:     Started server process [10615]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### 3. Check that your remote agent is running { #check-that-your-remote-agent-is-running }

You can check that your agent is up and running by visiting the agent card that was auto-generated earlier as part of your `to_a2a()` function in `a2a_root/remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`:

[http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json](http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json)

You should see the contents of the agent card, which should look like:

```json
{"capabilities":{},"defaultInputModes":["text/plain"],"defaultOutputModes":["text/plain"],"description":"hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers.","name":"hello_world_agent","protocolVersion":"0.2.6","skills":[{"description":"hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers. \n      I roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.\n      I can roll dice of different sizes.\n      I can use multiple tools in parallel by calling functions in parallel(in one request and in one round).\n      It is ok to discuss previous dice roles, and comment on the dice rolls.\n      When I are asked to roll a die, I must call the roll_die tool with the number of sides.

When I respond, I must include the roll_die result from step 1.\n      I should always perform the previous 3 steps when asking for a roll and checking prime numbers.\n      I should not rely on the previous history on prime results.\n    ","id":"hello_world_agent","name":"model","tags":["llm"]},{"description":"Roll a die and return the rolled result.\n\nArgs:\n  sides: The integer number of sides the die has.\n  tool_context: the tool context\nReturns:\n  An integer of the result of rolling the die.","id":"hello_world_agent-roll_die","name":"roll_die","tags":["llm","tools"]},{"description":"Check if a given list of numbers are prime.\n\nArgs:\n  nums: The list of numbers to check.\n\nReturns:\n  A str indicating which number is prime.","id":"hello_world_agent-check_prime","name":"check_prime","tags":["llm","tools"]}],"supportsAuthenticatedExtendedCard":false,"url":"http://localhost:8001","version":"0.0.1"}
```

### 4. Run the Main (Consuming) Agent { #run-the-main-consuming-agent }

Now that your remote agent is running, you can launch the dev UI and select "a2a_root" as your agent.

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run the adk web server
adk web contributing/samples/
```

To open the adk web server, go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Example Interactions

Once both services are running, you can interact with the root agent to see how it calls the remote agent via A2A:

**Simple Dice Rolling:**
This interaction uses a local agent, the Roll Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 6-sided die
Bot: I rolled a 4 for you.
```

**Prime Number Checking:**

This interaction uses a remote agent via A2A, the Prime Agent:

```text
User: Is 7 a prime number?
Bot: Yes, 7 is a prime number.
```

**Combined Operations:**

This interaction uses both the local Roll Agent and the remote Prime Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 10-sided die and check if it's prime
Bot: I rolled an 8 for you.
Bot: 8 is not a prime number.
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have created an agent that's exposing a remote agent via an A2A server, the next step is to learn how to consume it from another agent.

# Workflow Agents

This section introduces "*workflow agents*" - **specialized agents that control the execution flow of its sub-agents**.  

Workflow agents are specialized components in ADK designed purely for **orchestrating the execution flow of sub-agents**. Their primary role is to manage *how* and *when* other agents run, defining the control flow of a process.

Unlike [LLM Agents](../llm-agents.md), which use Large Language Models for dynamic reasoning and decision-making, Workflow Agents operate based on **predefined logic**. They determine the execution sequence according to their type (e.g., sequential, parallel, loop) without consulting an LLM for the orchestration itself. This results in **deterministic and predictable execution patterns**.

ADK provides three core workflow agent types, each implementing a distinct execution pattern:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-console-line: **Sequential Agents**

    ---

    Executes sub-agents one after another, in **sequence**.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](sequential-agents.md)

- :material-console-line: **Loop Agents**

    ---

    **Repeatedly** executes its sub-agents until a specific termination condition is met.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](loop-agents.md)

- :material-console-line: **Parallel Agents**

    ---

    Executes multiple sub-agents in **parallel**.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](parallel-agents.md)

</div>

## Why Use Workflow Agents?

Workflow agents are essential when you need explicit control over how a series of tasks or agents are executed. They provide:

* **Predictability:** The flow of execution is guaranteed based on the agent type and configuration.
* **Reliability:** Ensures tasks run in the required order or pattern consistently.
* **Structure:** Allows you to build complex processes by composing agents within clear control structures.

While the workflow agent manages the control flow deterministically, the sub-agents it orchestrates can themselves be any type of agent, including intelligent LLM Agent instances. This allows you to combine structured process control with flexible, LLM-powered task execution.

================
File: docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents.md
================
# Loop agents

## The `LoopAgent`

The `LoopAgent` is a workflow agent that executes its sub-agents in a loop (i.e. iteratively). It **_repeatedly runs_ a sequence of agents** for a specified number of iterations or until a termination condition is met.

Use the `LoopAgent` when your workflow involves repetition or iterative refinement, such as revising code.

### Example

* You want to build an agent that can generate images of food, but sometimes when you want to generate a specific number of items (e.g. 5 bananas), it generates a different number of those items in the image (e.g. an image of 7 bananas). You have two tools: `Generate Image`, `Count Food Items`. Because you want to keep generating images until it either correctly generates the specified number of items, or after a certain number of iterations, you should build your agent using a `LoopAgent`.

As with other [workflow agents](index.md), the `LoopAgent` is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned only with their execution (i.e. in a loop), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.

### How it Works

When the `LoopAgent`'s `Run Async` method is called, it performs the following actions:

1. **Sub-Agent Execution:**  It iterates through the Sub Agents list _in order_. For _each_ sub-agent, it calls the agent's `Run Async` method.
2. **Termination Check:**

    _Crucially_, the `LoopAgent` itself does _not_ inherently decide when to stop looping. You _must_ implement a termination mechanism to prevent infinite loops.  Common strategies include:

    * **Max Iterations**: Set a maximum number of iterations in the `LoopAgent`. **The loop will terminate after that many iterations**.
    * **Escalation from sub-agent**: Design one or more sub-agents to evaluate a condition (e.g., "Is the document quality good enough?", "Has a consensus been reached?").  If the condition is met, the sub-agent can signal termination (e.g., by raising a custom event, setting a flag in a shared context, or returning a specific value).

![Loop Agent](../../assets/loop-agent.png)

### Full Example: Iterative Document Improvement

Imagine a scenario where you want to iteratively improve a document:

* **Writer Agent:** An `LlmAgent` that generates or refines a draft on a topic.
* **Critic Agent:** An `LlmAgent` that critiques the draft, identifying areas for improvement.

    ```py
    LoopAgent(sub_agents=[WriterAgent, CriticAgent], max_iterations=5)
    ```

In this setup, the `LoopAgent` would manage the iterative process.  The `CriticAgent` could be **designed to return a "STOP" signal when the document reaches a satisfactory quality level**, preventing further iterations. Alternatively, the `max iterations` parameter could be used to limit the process to a fixed number of cycles, or external logic could be implemented to make stop decisions. The **loop would run at most five times**, ensuring the iterative refinement doesn't continue indefinitely.

================
# Parallel agents

The `ParallelAgent` is a [workflow agent](index.md) that executes its sub-agents *concurrently*. This dramatically speeds up workflows where tasks can be performed independently.

Use `ParallelAgent` when: For scenarios prioritizing speed and involving independent, resource-intensive tasks, a `ParallelAgent` facilitates efficient parallel execution. **When sub-agents operate without dependencies, their tasks can be performed concurrently**, significantly reducing overall processing time.

As with other [workflow agents](index.md), the `ParallelAgent` is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned with their execution (i.e. executing sub-agents in parallel), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.

### Example

This approach is particularly beneficial for operations like multi-source data retrieval or heavy computations, where parallelization yields substantial performance gains. Importantly, this strategy assumes no inherent need for shared state or direct information exchange between the concurrently executing agents.

### How it works

When the `ParallelAgent`'s `run_async()` method is called:

1. **Concurrent Execution:** It initiates the `run_async()` method of *each* sub-agent present in the `sub_agents` list *concurrently*.  This means all the agents start running at (approximately) the same time.
2. **Independent Branches:**  Each sub-agent operates in its own execution branch.  There is ***no* automatic sharing of conversation history or state between these branches** during execution.
3. **Result Collection:** The `ParallelAgent` manages the parallel execution and, typically, provides a way to access the results from each sub-agent after they have completed (e.g., through a list of results or events). The order of results may not be deterministic.

### Independent Execution and State Management

It's *crucial* to understand that sub-agents within a `ParallelAgent` run independently.  If you *need* communication or data sharing between these agents, you must implement it explicitly.  Possible approaches include:

* **Shared `InvocationContext`:** You could pass a shared `InvocationContext` object to each sub-agent.  This object could act as a shared data store.  However, you'd need to manage concurrent access to this shared context carefully (e.g., using locks) to avoid race conditions.
* **External State Management:**  Use an external database, message queue, or other mechanism to manage shared state and facilitate communication between agents.
* **Post-Processing:** Collect results from each branch, and then implement logic to coordinate data afterwards.

### Full Example: Parallel Web Research

Imagine researching multiple topics simultaneously:

1. **Researcher Agent 1:**  An `LlmAgent` that researches "renewable energy sources."
2. **Researcher Agent 2:**  An `LlmAgent` that researches "electric vehicle technology."
3. **Researcher Agent 3:**  An `LlmAgent` that researches "carbon capture methods."

    ```py
    ParallelAgent(sub_agents=[ResearcherAgent1, ResearcherAgent2, ResearcherAgent3])
    ```

These research tasks are independent.  Using a `ParallelAgent` allows them to run concurrently, potentially reducing the total research time significantly compared to running them sequentially. The results from each agent would be collected separately after they finish.

# Sequential agents

## The `SequentialAgent`

The `SequentialAgent` is a [workflow agent](index.md) that executes its sub-agents in the order they are specified in the list.

Use the `SequentialAgent` when you want the execution to occur in a fixed, strict order.

### Example

* You want to build an agent that can summarize any webpage, using two tools: `Get Page Contents` and `Summarize Page`. Because the agent must always call `Get Page Contents` before calling `Summarize Page` (you can't summarize from nothing!), you should build your agent using a `SequentialAgent`.

As with other [workflow agents](index.md), the `SequentialAgent` is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are concerned only with their execution (i.e. in sequence), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.

### How it works

When the `SequentialAgent`'s `Run Async` method is called, it performs the following actions:

1. **Iteration:** It iterates through the sub agents list in the order they were provided.
2. **Sub-Agent Execution:** For each sub-agent in the list, it calls the sub-agent's `Run Async` method.

![Sequential Agent](../../assets/sequential-agent.png){: width="600"}

### Full Example: Code Development Pipeline

Consider a simplified code development pipeline:

* **Code Writer Agent:**  An LLM Agent that generates initial code based on a specification.
* **Code Reviewer Agent:**  An LLM Agent that reviews the generated code for errors, style issues, and adherence to best practices.  It receives the output of the Code Writer Agent.
* **Code Refactorer Agent:** An LLM Agent that takes the reviewed code (and the reviewer's comments) and refactors it to improve quality and address issues.

A `SequentialAgent` is perfect for this:

```py
SequentialAgent(sub_agents=[CodeWriterAgent, CodeReviewerAgent, CodeRefactorerAgent])
```

This ensures the code is written, *then* reviewed, and *finally* refactored, in a strict, dependable order. **The output from each sub-agent is passed to the next by storing them in state via [Output Key](../llm-agents.md#structuring-data-input_schema-output_schema-output_key)**.

!!! note "Shared Invocation Context"
    The `SequentialAgent` passes the same `InvocationContext` to each of its sub-agents. This means they all share the same session state, including the temporary (`temp:`) namespace, making it easy to pass data between steps within a single turn.

# Build agents with Agent Config

The ADK Agent Config feature lets you build an ADK workflow without writing
code. An Agent Config uses a YAML format text file with a brief description of
the agent, allowing just about anyone to assemble and run an ADK agent. The
following is a simple example of an basic Agent Config definition:

```
name: assistant_agent
model: gemini-2.5-flash
description: A helper agent that can answer users' questions.
instruction: You are an agent to help answer users' various questions.
```

You can use Agent Config files to build more complex agents which can
incorporate Functions, Tools, Sub-Agents, and more. This page describes how to
build and run ADK workflows with the Agent Config feature. For detailed
information on the syntax and settings supported by the Agent Config format,
see the
[Agent Config syntax reference](/adk-docs/api-reference/agentconfig/).

!!! example "Experimental"
    The Agent Config feature is experimental and has some
    [known limitations](#known-limitations). We welcome your
    [feedback](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&labels=agent%20config)!

## Get started

This section describes how to set up and start building agents with the ADK and
the Agent Config feature, including installation setup, building an agent, and
running your agent.

### Setup

You need to install the Google Agent Development Kit libraries, and provide an
access key for a generative AI model such as Gemini API. This section provides
details on what you must install and configure before you can run agents with
the Agent Config files.

!!! note
    The Agent Config feature currently only supports Gemini models. For more
    information about additional; functional restrictions, see
    [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

To setup ADK for use with Agent Config:

1.  Install the ADK Python libraries by following the

    instructions. *Python is currently required.* For more information, see the
    [Known limitations](?tab=t.0#heading=h.xefmlyt7zh0i).
1.  Verify that ADK is installed by running the following command in your
    terminal:

        adk --version

    This command should show the ADK version you have installed.

!!! Tip
    If the `adk` command fails to run and the version is not listed in step 2, make
    sure your Python environment is active. Execute `source .venv/bin/activate` in
    your terminal on Mac and Linux. For other platform commands, see the
    [Installation](/adk-docs/get-started/installation/#python)
    page.

### Build an agent

You build an agent with Agent Config using the `adk create` command to create
the project files for an agent, and then editing the `root_agent.yaml` file it
generates for you.

To create an ADK project for use with Agent Config:

1.  In your terminal window, run the following command to create a
    config-based agent:

        adk create --type=config my_agent

    This command generates a `my_agent/` folder, containing a
    `root_agent.yaml` file and an `.env` file.

1.  In the `my_agent/.env` file, set environment variables for your agent to
    access generative AI models and other services:

    1.  For Gemini model access through Google API, add a line to the
        file with your API key:

            GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=0
            GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-Google-Gemini-API-key>

        You can get an API key from the Google AI Studio 
        [API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) page.

    1.  For Gemini model access through Google Cloud, add these lines to the file:

            GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
            GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your_gcp_project>
            GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1

        For information on creating a Cloud Project, see the Google Cloud docs
        for
        [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

1.  Using text editor, edit the Agent Config file
    `my_agent/root_agent.yaml`, as shown below:

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/adk-python/refs/heads/main/src/google/adk/agents/config_schemas/AgentConfig.json
name: assistant_agent
model: gemini-2.5-flash
description: A helper agent that can answer users' questions.
instruction: You are an agent to help answer users' various questions.
```

You can discover more configuration options for your `root_agent.yaml` agent
configuration file by referring to the ADK
[samples repository](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fadk-python+path%3A%2F%5Econtributing%5C%2Fsamples%5C%2F%2F+.yaml&type=code)
or the
[Agent Config syntax](/adk-docs/api-reference/agentconfig/)
reference.

### Run the agent

Once you have completed editing your Agent Config, you can run your agent using
the web interface, command line terminal execution, or API server mode.

To run your Agent Config-defined agent:

1.  In your terminal, navigate to the `my_agent/` directory containing the 
    `root_agent.yaml` file.
1.  Type one of the following commands to run your agent:
    -   `adk web` - Run web UI interface for your agent.
    -   `adk run` - Run your agent in the terminal without a user
        interface.
    -   `adk api_server` - Run your agent as a service that can be
        used by other applications.

For more information on the ways to run your agent, see the *Run Your Agent*
topic in the
[Quickstart](/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/#run-your-agent).
For more information about the ADK command line options, see the 
[ADK CLI reference](/adk-docs/api-reference/cli/).

## Example configs

This section shows examples of Agent Config files to get you started building
agents. For additional and more complete examples, see the ADK
[samples repository](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agoogle%2Fadk-python+path%3A%2F%5Econtributing%5C%2Fsamples%5C%2F%2F+root_agent.yaml&type=code).

### Built-in tool example

The following example uses a built-in ADK tool function for using google search
to provide functionality to the agent. This agent automatically uses the search
tool to reply to user requests.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/adk-python/refs/heads/main/src/google/adk/agents/config_schemas/AgentConfig.json
name: search_agent
model: gemini-2.0-flash
description: 'an agent whose job it is to perform Google search queries and answer questions about the results.'
instruction: You are an agent whose job is to perform Google search queries and answer questions about the results.
tools:
  - name: google_search
```

For more details, see the full code for this sample in the
[ADK sample repository](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/contributing/samples/tool_builtin_config/root_agent.yaml).

### Custom tool example

The following example uses a custom tool built with Python code and listed in
the `tools:` section of the config file. The agent uses this tool to check if a
list of numbers provided by the user are prime numbers.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/adk-python/refs/heads/main/src/google/adk/agents/config_schemas/AgentConfig.json
agent_class: LlmAgent
model: gemini-2.5-flash
name: prime_agent
description: Handles checking if numbers are prime.
instruction: |
  You are responsible for checking whether numbers are prime.
  When asked to check primes, you must call the check_prime tool with a list of integers.
  Never attempt to determine prime numbers manually.
  Return the prime number results to the root agent.
tools:
  - name: ma_llm.check_prime
```

For more details, see the full code for this sample in the
[ADK sample repository](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/contributing/samples/multi_agent_llm_config/prime_agent.yaml).

### Sub-agents example

The following example shows an agent defined with two sub-agents in the
`sub_agents:` section, and an example tool in the `tools:` section of the config
file. This agent determines what the user wants, and delegates to one of the
sub-agents to resolve the request. The sub-agents are defined using Agent Config
YAML files.

```
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/adk-python/refs/heads/main/src/google/adk/agents/config_schemas/AgentConfig.json
agent_class: LlmAgent
model: gemini-2.5-flash
name: root_agent
description: Learning assistant that provides tutoring in code and math.
instruction: |
  You are a learning assistant that helps students with coding and math questions.

  You delegate coding questions to the code_tutor_agent and math questions to the math_tutor_agent.

  Follow these steps:
  1. If the user asks about programming or coding, delegate to the code_tutor_agent.
  2. If the user asks about math concepts or problems, delegate to the math_tutor_agent.
  3. Always provide clear explanations and encourage learning.
sub_agents:
  - config_path: code_tutor_agent.yaml
  - config_path: math_tutor_agent.yaml
```

For more details, see the full code for this sample in the
[ADK sample repository](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/contributing/samples/multi_agent_basic_config/root_agent.yaml).

## Deploy agent configs

You can deploy Agent Config agents with 
[Cloud Run](/adk-docs/deploy/cloud-run/) and 
[Agent Engine](/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/), 
using the same procedure as code-based agents. For more information on how 
to prepare and deploy Agent Config-based agents, see the 
[Cloud Run](/adk-docs/deploy/cloud-run/) and 
[Agent Engine](/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/)
deployment guides.

!!! warning "Advanced Concept"

    Building custom agents by directly implementing `_run_async_impl` (or its equivalent in other languages) provides powerful control but is more complex than using the predefined `LlmAgent` or standard `WorkflowAgent` types. We recommend understanding those foundational agent types first before tackling custom orchestration logic.

# Custom agents

Custom agents provide the ultimate flexibility in ADK, allowing you to define **arbitrary orchestration logic** by inheriting directly from `BaseAgent` and implementing your own control flow. This goes beyond the predefined patterns of `SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, and `ParallelAgent`, enabling you to build highly specific and complex agentic workflows.

## Introduction: Beyond Predefined Workflows

### What is a Custom Agent?

A Custom Agent is essentially any class you create that inherits from `google.adk.agents.BaseAgent` and implements its core execution logic within the `_run_async_impl` asynchronous method. You have complete control over how this method calls other agents (sub-agents), manages state, and handles events. 

!!! Note
    The specific method name for implementing an agent's core asynchronous logic may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `runAsyncImpl` in Java, `_run_async_impl` in Python). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Why Use Them?

While the standard [Workflow Agents](workflow-agents/index.md) (`SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`) cover common orchestration patterns, you'll need a Custom agent when your requirements include:

* **Conditional Logic:** Executing different sub-agents or taking different paths based on runtime conditions or the results of previous steps.
* **Complex State Management:** Implementing intricate logic for maintaining and updating state throughout the workflow beyond simple sequential passing.
* **External Integrations:** Incorporating calls to external APIs, databases, or custom libraries directly within the orchestration flow control.
* **Dynamic Agent Selection:** Choosing which sub-agent(s) to run next based on dynamic evaluation of the situation or input.
* **Unique Workflow Patterns:** Implementing orchestration logic that doesn't fit the standard sequential, parallel, or loop structures.


![intro_components.png](../assets/custom-agent-flow.png)


## Implementing Custom Logic:

The core of any custom agent is the method where you define its unique asynchronous behavior. This method allows you to orchestrate sub-agents and manage the flow of execution.

=== "Python"

      The heart of any custom agent is the `_run_async_impl` method. This is where you define its unique behavior.
      
      * **Signature:** `async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:`
      * **Asynchronous Generator:** It must be an `async def` function and return an `AsyncGenerator`. This allows it to `yield` events produced by sub-agents or its own logic back to the runner.
      * **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session.state`, which is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.

=== "Java"

    The heart of any custom agent is the `runAsyncImpl` method, which you override from `BaseAgent`.

    *   **Signature:** `protected Flowable<Event> runAsyncImpl(InvocationContext ctx)`
    *   **Reactive Stream (`Flowable`):** It must return an `io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Flowable<Event>`. This `Flowable` represents a stream of events that will be produced by the custom agent's logic, often by combining or transforming multiple `Flowable` from sub-agents.
    *   **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session().state()`, which is a `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap<String, Object>`. This is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.

**Key Capabilities within the Core Asynchronous Method:**

=== "Python"

    1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance attributes like `self.my_llm_agent`) using their `run_async` method and yield their events:

          ```python
          async for event in self.some_sub_agent.run_async(ctx):
              # Optionally inspect or log the event
              yield event # Pass the event up
          ```

    2. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state dictionary (`ctx.session.state`) to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions:
          ```python
          # Read data set by a previous agent
          previous_result = ctx.session.state.get("some_key")
      
          # Make a decision based on state
          if previous_result == "some_value":
              # ... call a specific sub-agent ...
          else:
              # ... call another sub-agent ...
      
          # Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent's output_key)
          # ctx.session.state["my_custom_result"] = "calculated_value"
          ```

    3. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard Python constructs (`if`/`elif`/`else`, `for`/`while` loops, `try`/`except`) to create sophisticated, conditional, or iterative workflows involving your sub-agents.

=== "Java"

    1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance attributes or objects) using their asynchronous run method and return their event streams:

           You typically chain `Flowable`s from sub-agents using RxJava operators like `concatWith`, `flatMapPublisher`, or `concatArray`.

           ```java
           // Example: Running one sub-agent
           // return someSubAgent.runAsync(ctx);
      
           // Example: Running sub-agents sequentially
           Flowable<Event> firstAgentEvents = someSubAgent1.runAsync(ctx)
               .doOnNext(event -> System.out.println("Event from agent 1: " + event.id()));
      
           Flowable<Event> secondAgentEvents = Flowable.defer(() ->
               someSubAgent2.runAsync(ctx)
                   .doOnNext(event -> System.out.println("Event from agent 2: " + event.id()))
           );
      
           return firstAgentEvents.concatWith(secondAgentEvents);
           ```
           The `Flowable.defer()` is often used for subsequent stages if their execution depends on the completion or state after prior stages.

    2. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions. The session state is a `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap<String, Object>` obtained via `ctx.session().state()`.
        
        ```java
        // Read data set by a previous agent
        Object previousResult = ctx.session().state().get("some_key");

        // Make a decision based on state
        if ("some_value".equals(previousResult)) {
            // ... logic to include a specific sub-agent's Flowable ...
        } else {
            // ... logic to include another sub-agent's Flowable ...
        }

        // Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent's output_key)
        // ctx.session().state().put("my_custom_result", "calculated_value");
        ```

    3. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard language constructs (`if`/`else`, loops, `try`/`catch`) combined with reactive operators (RxJava) to create sophisticated workflows.

          *   **Conditional:** `Flowable.defer()` to choose which `Flowable` to subscribe to based on a condition, or `filter()` if you're filtering events within a stream.
          *   **Iterative:** Operators like `repeat()`, `retry()`, or by structuring your `Flowable` chain to recursively call parts of itself based on conditions (often managed with `flatMapPublisher` or `concatMap`).

## Managing Sub-Agents and State

Typically, a custom agent orchestrates other agents (like `LlmAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc.).

* **Initialization:** You usually pass instances of these sub-agents into your custom agent's constructor and store them as instance fields/attributes (e.g., `this.story_generator = story_generator_instance` or `self.story_generator = story_generator_instance`). This makes them accessible within the custom agent's core asynchronous execution logic (such as: `_run_async_impl` method).
* **Sub Agents List:** When initializing the `BaseAgent` using it's `super()` constructor, you should pass a `sub agents` list. This list tells the ADK framework about the agents that are part of this custom agent's immediate hierarchy. It's important for framework features like lifecycle management, introspection, and potentially future routing capabilities, even if your core execution logic (`_run_async_impl`) calls the agents directly via `self.xxx_agent`. Include the agents that your custom logic directly invokes at the top level.
* **State:** As mentioned, `ctx.session.state` is the standard way sub-agents (especially `LlmAgent`s using `output key`) communicate results back to the orchestrator and how the orchestrator passes necessary inputs down.

## Design Pattern Example: `StoryFlowAgent`

Let's illustrate the power of custom agents with an example pattern: a multi-stage content generation workflow with conditional logic.

**Goal:** Create a system that generates a story, iteratively refines it through critique and revision, performs final checks, and crucially, *regenerates the story if the final tone check fails*.

**Why Custom?** The core requirement driving the need for a custom agent here is the **conditional regeneration based on the tone check**. Standard workflow agents don't have built-in conditional branching based on the outcome of a sub-agent's task. We need custom logic (`if tone == "negative": ...`) within the orchestrator.

---

### Part 1: Simplified custom agent Initialization { #part-1-simplified-custom-agent-initialization }

=== "Python"

    We define the `StoryFlowAgent` inheriting from `BaseAgent`. In `__init__`, we store the necessary sub-agents (passed in) as instance attributes and tell the `BaseAgent` framework about the top-level agents this custom agent will directly orchestrate.
    
    ```python
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:init"
    ```

=== "Java"

    We define the `StoryFlowAgentExample` by extending `BaseAgent`. In its **constructor**, we store the necessary sub-agent instances (passed as parameters) as instance fields. These top-level sub-agents, which this custom agent will directly orchestrate, are also passed to the `super` constructor of `BaseAgent` as a list.

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/agents/StoryFlowAgentExample.java:init"
    ```
---

### Part 2: Defining the Custom Execution Logic { #part-2-defining-the-custom-execution-logic }

=== "Python"

    This method orchestrates the sub-agents using standard Python async/await and control flow.
    
    ```python
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:executionlogic"
    ```
    **Explanation of Logic:**

    1. The initial `story_generator` runs. Its output is expected to be in `ctx.session.state["current_story"]`.
    2. The `loop_agent` runs, which internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sequentially for `max_iterations` times. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
    3. The `sequential_agent` runs, calling `grammar_check` then `tone_check`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
    4. **Custom Part:** The `if` statement checks the `tone_check_result` from the state. If it's "negative", the `story_generator` is called *again*, overwriting the `current_story` in the state. Otherwise, the flow ends.


=== "Java"
    
    The `runAsyncImpl` method orchestrates the sub-agents using RxJava's Flowable streams and operators for asynchronous control flow.

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/agents/StoryFlowAgentExample.java:executionlogic"
    ```
    **Explanation of Logic:**

    1. The initial `storyGenerator.runAsync(invocationContext)` Flowable is executed. Its output is expected to be in `invocationContext.session().state().get("current_story")`.
    2. The `loopAgent's` Flowable runs next (due to `Flowable.concatArray` and `Flowable.defer`). The LoopAgent internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sub-agents sequentially for up to `maxIterations`. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
    3. Then, the `sequentialAgent's` Flowable executes. It calls the `grammar_check` then `tone_check`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
    4. **Custom Part:** After the sequentialAgent completes, logic within a `Flowable.defer` checks the "tone_check_result" from `invocationContext.session().state()`. If it's "negative", the `storyGenerator` Flowable is *conditionally concatenated* and executed again, overwriting "current_story". Otherwise, an empty Flowable is used, and the overall workflow proceeds to completion.

---

### Part 3: Defining the LLM Sub-Agents { #part-3-defining-the-llm-sub-agents }

These are standard `LlmAgent` definitions, responsible for specific tasks. Their `output key` parameter is crucial for placing results into the `session.state` where other agents or the custom orchestrator can access them.

!!! tip "Direct State Injection in Instructions"
    Notice the `story_generator`'s instruction. The `{var}` syntax is a placeholder. Before the instruction is sent to the LLM, the ADK framework automatically replaces (Example:`{topic}`) with the value of `session.state['topic']`. This is the recommended way to provide context to an agent, using templating in the instructions. For more details, see the [State documentation](../sessions/state.md#accessing-session-state-in-agent-instructions).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    GEMINI_2_FLASH = "gemini-2.0-flash" # Define model constant
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:llmagents"
    ```
=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/agents/StoryFlowAgentExample.java:llmagents"
    ```

---

### Part 4: Instantiating and Running the custom agent { #part-4-instantiating-and-running-the-custom-agent }

Finally, you instantiate your `StoryFlowAgent` and use the `Runner` as usual.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/agents/custom-agent/storyflow_agent.py:story_flow_agent"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java

# Agents

In the Agent Development Kit (ADK), an **Agent** is a self-contained execution unit designed to act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Agents can perform tasks, interact with users, utilize external tools, and coordinate with other agents.

The foundation for all agents in ADK is the `BaseAgent` class. It serves as the fundamental blueprint. To create functional agents, you typically extend `BaseAgent` in one of three main ways, catering to different needs – from intelligent reasoning to structured process control.

<img src="../assets/agent-types.png" alt="Types of agents in ADK">

## Core Agent Categories

ADK provides distinct agent categories to build sophisticated applications:

1. [**LLM Agents (`LlmAgent`, `Agent`)**](llm-agents.md): These agents utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as their core engine to understand natural language, reason, plan, generate responses, and dynamically decide how to proceed or which tools to use, making them ideal for flexible, language-centric tasks. [Learn more about LLM Agents...](llm-agents.md)

2. [**Workflow Agents (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`)**](workflow-agents/index.md): These specialized agents control the execution flow of other agents in predefined, deterministic patterns (sequence, parallel, or loop) without using an LLM for the flow control itself, perfect for structured processes needing predictable execution. [Explore Workflow Agents...](workflow-agents/index.md)

3. [**Custom Agents**](custom-agents.md): Created by extending `BaseAgent` directly, these agents allow you to implement unique operational logic, specific control flows, or specialized integrations not covered by the standard types, catering to highly tailored application requirements. [Discover how to build Custom Agents...](custom-agents.md)

## Choosing the Right Agent Type

The following table provides a high-level comparison to help distinguish between the agent types. As you explore each type in more detail in the subsequent sections, these distinctions will become clearer.

| Feature              | LLM Agent (`LlmAgent`)              | Workflow Agent                              | Custom Agent (`BaseAgent` subclass)      |

## Agents Working Together: Multi-Agent Systems

While each agent type serves a distinct purpose, the true power often comes from combining them. Complex applications frequently employ [multi-agent architectures](multi-agents.md) where:

* **LLM Agents** handle intelligent, language-based task execution.
* **Workflow Agents** manage the overall process flow using standard patterns.
* **Custom Agents** provide specialized capabilities or rules needed for unique integrations.

Understanding these core types is the first step toward building sophisticated, capable AI applications with ADK.

# LLM Agent

The `LlmAgent` (often aliased simply as `Agent`) is a core component in ADK,
acting as the "thinking" part of your application. It leverages the power of a
Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning, understanding natural language, making
decisions, generating responses, and interacting with tools.

Unlike deterministic [Workflow Agents](workflow-agents/index.md) that follow
predefined execution paths, `LlmAgent` behavior is non-deterministic. It uses
the LLM to interpret instructions and context, deciding dynamically how to
proceed, which tools to use (if any), or whether to transfer control to another
agent.

Building an effective `LlmAgent` involves defining its identity, clearly guiding
its behavior through instructions, and equipping it with the necessary tools and
capabilities.

## Defining the Agent's Identity and Purpose

First, you need to establish what the agent *is* and what it's *for*.

* **`name` (Required):** Every agent needs a unique string identifier. This
  `name` is crucial for internal operations, especially in multi-agent systems
  where agents need to refer to or delegate tasks to each other. Choose a
  descriptive name that reflects the agent's function (e.g.,
  `customer_support_router`, `billing_inquiry_agent`). Avoid reserved names like
  `user`.

* **`description` (Optional, Recommended for Multi-Agent):** Provide a concise
  summary of the agent's capabilities. This description is primarily used by
  *other* LLM agents to determine if they should route a task to this agent.
  Make it specific enough to differentiate it from peers (e.g., "Handles
  inquiries about current billing statements," not just "Billing agent").

* **`model` (Required):** Specify the underlying LLM that will power this
  agent's reasoning. This is a string identifier like `"gemini-2.0-flash"`. The
  choice of model impacts the agent's capabilities, cost, and performance. See
  the [Models](models.md) page for available options and considerations.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Example: Defining the basic identity
    capital_agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="capital_agent",
        description="Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country."
        # instruction and tools will be added next
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Example: Defining the basic identity
    LlmAgent capitalAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .name("capital_agent")
            .description("Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.")
            // instruction and tools will be added next
            .build();
    ```


## Guiding the Agent: Instructions (`instruction`)

The `instruction` parameter is arguably the most critical for shaping an
`LlmAgent`'s behavior. It's a string (or a function returning a string) that
tells the agent:

* Its core task or goal.
* Its personality or persona (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant," "You are a witty pirate").
* Constraints on its behavior (e.g., "Only answer questions about X," "Never reveal Y").
* How and when to use its `tools`. You should explain the purpose of each tool and the circumstances under which it should be called, supplementing any descriptions within the tool itself.
* The desired format for its output (e.g., "Respond in JSON," "Provide a bulleted list").

**Tips for Effective Instructions:**

* **Be Clear and Specific:** Avoid ambiguity. Clearly state the desired actions and outcomes.
* **Use Markdown:** Improve readability for complex instructions using headings, lists, etc.
* **Provide Examples (Few-Shot):** For complex tasks or specific output formats, include examples directly in the instruction.
* **Guide Tool Use:** Don't just list tools; explain *when* and *why* the agent should use them.

**State:**

* The instruction is a string template, you can use the `{var}` syntax to insert dynamic values into the instruction.
* `{var}` is used to insert the value of the state variable named var.
* `{artifact.var}` is used to insert the text content of the artifact named var.
* If the state variable or artifact does not exist, the agent will raise an error. If you want to ignore the error, you can append a `?` to the variable name as in `{var?}`.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Example: Adding instructions
    capital_agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="capital_agent",
        description="Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.",
        instruction="""You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country.
    When a user asks for the capital of a country:
    1. Identify the country name from the user's query.
    2. Use the `get_capital_city` tool to find the capital.
    3. Respond clearly to the user, stating the capital city.
    Example Query: "What's the capital of {country}?"
    Example Response: "The capital of France is Paris."
    """,
        # tools will be added next
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Example: Adding instructions
    LlmAgent capitalAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .name("capital_agent")
            .description("Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.")
            .instruction(
                """
                You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country.
                When a user asks for the capital of a country:
                1. Identify the country name from the user's query.
                2. Use the `get_capital_city` tool to find the capital.
                3. Respond clearly to the user, stating the capital city.
                Example Query: "What's the capital of {country}?"
                Example Response: "The capital of France is Paris."
                """)
            // tools will be added next
            .build();
    ```

*(Note: For instructions that apply to *all* agents in a system, consider using
`global_instruction` on the root agent, detailed further in the
[Multi-Agents](multi-agents.md) section.)*

## Equipping the Agent: Tools (`tools`)

Tools give your `LlmAgent` capabilities beyond the LLM's built-in knowledge or
reasoning. They allow the agent to interact with the outside world, perform
calculations, fetch real-time data, or execute specific actions.

* **`tools` (Optional):** Provide a list of tools the agent can use. Each item in the list can be:
    * A native function or method (wrapped as a `FunctionTool`). Python ADK automatically wraps the native function into a `FuntionTool` whereas, you must explicitly wrap your Java methods using `FunctionTool.create(...)`
    * An instance of a class inheriting from `BaseTool`.
    * An instance of another agent (`AgentTool`, enabling agent-to-agent delegation - see [Multi-Agents](multi-agents.md)).

The LLM uses the function/tool names, descriptions (from docstrings or the
`description` field), and parameter schemas to decide which tool to call based
on the conversation and its instructions.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Define a tool function
    def get_capital_city(country: str) -> str:
      """Retrieves the capital city for a given country."""
      # Replace with actual logic (e.g., API call, database lookup)
      capitals = {"france": "Paris", "japan": "Tokyo", "canada": "Ottawa"}
      return capitals.get(country.lower(), f"Sorry, I don't know the capital of {country}.")
    
    # Add the tool to the agent
    capital_agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="capital_agent",
        description="Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.",
        instruction="""You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country... (previous instruction text)""",
        tools=[get_capital_city] # Provide the function directly
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    
    // Define a tool function
    // Retrieves the capital city of a given country.
    public static Map<String, Object> getCapitalCity(
            @Schema(name = "country", description = "The country to get capital for")
            String country) {
      // Replace with actual logic (e.g., API call, database lookup)
      Map<String, String> countryCapitals = new HashMap<>();
      countryCapitals.put("canada", "Ottawa");
      countryCapitals.put("france", "Paris");
      countryCapitals.put("japan", "Tokyo");
    
      String result =
              countryCapitals.getOrDefault(
                      country.toLowerCase(), "Sorry, I couldn't find the capital for " + country + ".");
      return Map.of("result", result); // Tools must return a Map
    }
    
    // Add the tool to the agent
    FunctionTool capitalTool = FunctionTool.create(experiment.getClass(), "getCapitalCity");
    LlmAgent capitalAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .name("capital_agent")
            .description("Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.")
            .instruction("You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country... (previous instruction text)")
            .tools(capitalTool) // Provide the function wrapped as a FunctionTool
            .build();
    ```

Learn more about Tools in the [Tools](../tools/index.md) section.

## Advanced Configuration & Control

Beyond the core parameters, `LlmAgent` offers several options for finer control:

### Configuring LLM Generation (`generate_content_config`) {#fine-tuning-llm-generation-generate_content_config}

You can adjust how the underlying LLM generates responses using `generate_content_config`.

* **`generate_content_config` (Optional):** Pass an instance of [`google.genai.types.GenerateContentConfig`](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/genai.html#genai.types.GenerateContentConfig) to control parameters like `temperature` (randomness), `max_output_tokens` (response length), `top_p`, `top_k`, and safety settings.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.genai import types

    agent = LlmAgent(
        # ... other params
        generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            temperature=0.2, # More deterministic output
            max_output_tokens=250,
            safety_settings=[
                types.SafetySetting(
                    category=types.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT,
                    threshold=types.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,
                )
            ]
        )
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.genai.types.GenerateContentConfig;

    LlmAgent agent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            // ... other params
            .generateContentConfig(GenerateContentConfig.builder()
                .temperature(0.2F) // More deterministic output
                .maxOutputTokens(250)
                .build())
            .build();
    ```

### Structuring Data (`input_schema`, `output_schema`, `output_key`)

For scenarios requiring structured data exchange with an `LLM Agent`, the ADK provides mechanisms to define expected input and desired output formats using schema definitions.

* **`input_schema` (Optional):** Define a schema representing the expected input structure. If set, the user message content passed to this agent *must* be a JSON string conforming to this schema. Your instructions should guide the user or preceding agent accordingly.

* **`output_schema` (Optional):** Define a schema representing the desired output structure. If set, the agent's final response *must* be a JSON string conforming to this schema.

* **`output_key` (Optional):** Provide a string key. If set, the text content of the agent's *final* response will be automatically saved to the session's state dictionary under this key. This is useful for passing results between agents or steps in a workflow.
    * In Python, this might look like: `session.state[output_key] = agent_response_text`
    * In Java: `session.state().put(outputKey, agentResponseText)`

=== "Python"

    The input and output schema is typically a `Pydantic` BaseModel.

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    
    class CapitalOutput(BaseModel):
        capital: str = Field(description="The capital of the country.")
    
    structured_capital_agent = LlmAgent(
        # ... name, model, description
        instruction="""You are a Capital Information Agent. Given a country, respond ONLY with a JSON object containing the capital. Format: {"capital": "capital_name"}""",
        output_schema=CapitalOutput, # Enforce JSON output
        output_key="found_capital"  # Store result in state['found_capital']
        # Cannot use tools=[get_capital_city] effectively here
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

     The input and output schema is a `google.genai.types.Schema` object.

    ```java
    private static final Schema CAPITAL_OUTPUT =
        Schema.builder()
            .type("OBJECT")
            .description("Schema for capital city information.")
            .properties(
                Map.of(
                    "capital",
                    Schema.builder()
                        .type("STRING")
                        .description("The capital city of the country.")
                        .build()))
            .build();
    
    LlmAgent structuredCapitalAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            // ... name, model, description
            .instruction(
                    "You are a Capital Information Agent. Given a country, respond ONLY with a JSON object containing the capital. Format: {\"capital\": \"capital_name\"}")
            .outputSchema(capitalOutput) // Enforce JSON output
            .outputKey("found_capital") // Store result in state.get("found_capital")
            // Cannot use tools(getCapitalCity) effectively here
            .build();
    ```

### Managing Context (`include_contents`)

Control whether the agent receives the prior conversation history.

* **`include_contents` (Optional, Default: `'default'`):** Determines if the `contents` (history) are sent to the LLM.
    * `'default'`: The agent receives the relevant conversation history.
    * `'none'`: The agent receives no prior `contents`. It operates based solely on its current instruction and any input provided in the *current* turn (useful for stateless tasks or enforcing specific contexts).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    stateless_agent = LlmAgent(
        # ... other params
        include_contents='none'
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent.IncludeContents;
    
    LlmAgent statelessAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            // ... other params
            .includeContents(IncludeContents.NONE)
            .build();
    ```

### Planner

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

**`planner` (Optional):** Assign a `BasePlanner` instance to enable multi-step reasoning and planning before execution. There are two main planners:

* **`BuiltInPlanner`:** Leverages the model's built-in planning capabilities (e.g., Gemini's thinking feature). See [Gemini Thinking](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) for details and examples.

    Here, the `thinking_budget` parameter guides the model on the number of thinking tokens to use when generating a response. The `include_thoughts` parameter controls whether the model should include its raw thoughts and internal reasoning process in the response.

    ```python
    from google.adk import Agent
    from google.adk.planners import BuiltInPlanner
    from google.genai import types

    my_agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash",
        planner=BuiltInPlanner(
            thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
                include_thoughts=True,
                thinking_budget=1024,
            )
        ),
        # ... your tools here
    )
    ```
    
* **`PlanReActPlanner`:** This planner instructs the model to follow a specific structure in its output: first create a plan, then execute actions (like calling tools), and provide reasoning for its steps. *It's particularly useful for models that don't have a built-in "thinking" feature*.

    ```python
    from google.adk import Agent
    from google.adk.planners import PlanReActPlanner

    my_agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        planner=PlanReActPlanner(),
        # ... your tools here
    )
    ```

    The agent's response will follow a structured format:

    ```
    [user]: ai news
    [google_search_agent]: /*PLANNING*/
    1. Perform a Google search for "latest AI news" to get current updates and headlines related to artificial intelligence.
    2. Synthesize the information from the search results to provide a summary of recent AI news.

    /*ACTION*/
    /*REASONING*/
    The search results provide a comprehensive overview of recent AI news, covering various aspects like company developments, research breakthroughs, and applications. I have enough information to answer the user's request.

    /*FINAL_ANSWER*/
    Here's a summary of recent AI news:
    ....
    ```

### Code Execution

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

* **`code_executor` (Optional):** Provide a `BaseCodeExecutor` instance to allow the agent to execute code blocks found in the LLM's response. ([See Tools/Built-in tools](../tools/built-in-tools.md)).

Example for using built-in-planner:
```python

While this page covers the core configuration of `LlmAgent`, several related concepts provide more advanced control and are detailed elsewhere:

* **Callbacks:** Intercepting execution points (before/after model calls, before/after tool calls) using `before_model_callback`, `after_model_callback`, etc. See [Callbacks](../callbacks/types-of-callbacks.md).
* **Multi-Agent Control:** Advanced strategies for agent interaction, including planning (`planner`), controlling agent transfer (`disallow_transfer_to_parent`, `disallow_transfer_to_peers`), and system-wide instructions (`global_instruction`). See [Multi-Agents](multi-agents.md).

# Using Different Models with ADK

!!! Note
    Java ADK currently supports Gemini and Anthropic models. More model support coming soon.

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for flexibility, allowing you to
integrate various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your agents. While the setup
for Google Gemini models is covered in the
[Setup Foundation Models](../get-started/installation.md) guide, this page
details how to leverage Gemini effectively and integrate other popular models,
including those hosted externally or running locally.

ADK primarily uses two mechanisms for model integration:

1. **Direct String / Registry:** For models tightly integrated with Google Cloud
   (like Gemini models accessed via Google AI Studio or Vertex AI) or models
   hosted on Vertex AI endpoints. You typically provide the model name or
   endpoint resource string directly to the `LlmAgent`. ADK's internal registry
   resolves this string to the appropriate backend client, often utilizing the
   `google-genai` library.
2. **Wrapper Classes:** For broader compatibility, especially with models
   outside the Google ecosystem or those requiring specific client
   configurations (like models accessed via LiteLLM). You instantiate a specific
   wrapper class (e.g., `LiteLlm`) and pass this object as the `model` parameter
   to your `LlmAgent`.

The following sections guide you through using these methods based on your needs.

## Using Google Gemini Models

This section covers authenticating with Google's Gemini models, either through Google AI Studio for rapid development or Google Cloud Vertex AI for enterprise applications. This is the most direct way to use Google's flagship models within ADK.

**Integration Method:** Once you are authenticated using one of the below methods, you can pass the model's identifier string directly to the
`model` parameter of `LlmAgent`.


!!!tip 

    The `google-genai` library, used internally by ADK for Gemini models, can connect
    through either Google AI Studio or Vertex AI.

    **Model support for voice/video streaming**

    In order to use voice/video streaming in ADK, you will need to use Gemini
    models that support the Live API. You can find the **model ID(s)** that
    support the Gemini Live API in the documentation:

    - [Google AI Studio: Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#live-api)
    - [Vertex AI: Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)

### Google AI Studio

This is the simplest method and is recommended for getting started quickly.

*   **Authentication Method:** API Key
*   **Setup:**
    1.  **Get an API key:** Obtain your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2.  **Set environment variables:** Create a `.env` file (Python) or `.properties` (Java) in your project's root directory and add the following lines. ADK will automatically load this file.

        ```shell
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        ```

        (or)
        
        Pass these variables during the model initialization via the `Client` (see example below).

* **Models:** Find all available models on the
  [Google AI for Developers site](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models).

### Google Cloud Vertex AI

For scalable and production-oriented use cases, Vertex AI is the recommended platform. Gemini on Vertex AI supports enterprise-grade features, security, and compliance controls. Based on your development environment and usecase, *choose one of the below methods to authenticate*.

**Pre-requisites:** A Google Cloud Project with [Vertex AI enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow;apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

### **Method A: User Credentials (for Local Development)**

1.  **Install the gcloud CLI:** Follow the official [installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2.  **Log in using ADC:** This command opens a browser to authenticate your user account for local development.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
3.  **Set environment variables:**
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION" # e.g., us-central1
    ```     
    
    Explicitly tell the library to use Vertex AI:

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    ```

4. **Models:** Find available model IDs in the
  [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models).

### **Method B: Vertex AI Express Mode**
[Vertex AI Express Mode](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview) offers a simplified, API-key-based setup for rapid prototyping.

1.  **Sign up for Express Mode** to get your API key.
2.  **Set environment variables:**
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_EXPRESS_MODE_API_KEY_HERE"
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    ```

### **Method C: Service Account (for Production & Automation)**

For deployed applications, a service account is the standard method.

1.  [**Create a Service Account**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#console) and grant it the `Vertex AI User` role.
2.  **Provide credentials to your application:**
    *   **On Google Cloud:** If you are running the agent in Cloud Run, GKE, VM or other Google Cloud services, the environment can automatically provide the service account credentials. You don't have to create a key file.
    *   **Elsewhere:** Create a [service account key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#console) and point to it with an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/keyfile.json"
        ```
    Instead of the key file, you can also authenticate the service account using Workload Identity. But this is outside the scope of this guide.

**Example:**

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    
    # --- Example using a stable Gemini Flash model ---
    agent_gemini_flash = LlmAgent(
        # Use the latest stable Flash model identifier
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="gemini_flash_agent",
        instruction="You are a fast and helpful Gemini assistant.",
        # ... other agent parameters
    )
    
    # --- Example using a powerful Gemini Pro model ---
    # Note: Always check the official Gemini documentation for the latest model names,
    # including specific preview versions if needed. Preview models might have
    # different availability or quota limitations.
    agent_gemini_pro = LlmAgent(
        # Use the latest generally available Pro model identifier
        model="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25",
        name="gemini_pro_agent",
        instruction="You are a powerful and knowledgeable Gemini assistant.",
        # ... other agent parameters
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // --- Example #1: using a stable Gemini Flash model with ENV variables---
    LlmAgent agentGeminiFlash =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            // Use the latest stable Flash model identifier
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash") // Set ENV variables to use this model
            .name("gemini_flash_agent")
            .instruction("You are a fast and helpful Gemini assistant.")
            // ... other agent parameters
            .build();

    // --- Example #2: using a powerful Gemini Pro model with API Key in model ---
    LlmAgent agentGeminiPro =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            // Use the latest generally available Pro model identifier
            .model(new Gemini("gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25",
                Client.builder()
                    .vertexAI(false)
                    .apiKey("API_KEY") // Set the API Key (or) project/ location
                    .build()))
            // Or, you can also directly pass the API_KEY
            // .model(new Gemini("gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25", "API_KEY"))
            .name("gemini_pro_agent")
            .instruction("You are a powerful and knowledgeable Gemini assistant.")
            // ... other agent parameters
            .build();

    // Note: Always check the official Gemini documentation for the latest model names,
    // including specific preview versions if needed. Preview models might have
    // different availability or quota limitations.
    ```

!!!warning "Secure Your Credentials"
    Service account credentials or API keys are powerful credentials. Never expose them publicly. Use a secret manager like [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) to store and access them securely in production.

## Using Anthropic models

![java_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Java-orange){ title="This feature is currently available for Java. Python support for direct Anthropic API (non-Vertex) is via LiteLLM."}

You can integrate Anthropic's Claude models directly using their API key or from a Vertex AI backend into your Java ADK applications by using the ADK's `Claude` wrapper class.

For Vertex AI backend, see the [Third-Party Models on Vertex AI](#third-party-models-on-vertex-ai-eg-anthropic-claude) section.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Dependencies:**
    *   **Anthropic SDK Classes (Transitive):** The Java ADK's `com.google.adk.models.Claude` wrapper relies on classes from Anthropic's official Java SDK. These are typically included as **transitive dependencies**.

2.  **Anthropic API Key:**
    *   Obtain an API key from Anthropic. Securely manage this key using a secret manager.

**Integration:**

Instantiate `com.google.adk.models.Claude`, providing the desired Claude model name and an `AnthropicOkHttpClient` configured with your API key. Then, pass this `Claude` instance to your `LlmAgent`.

**Example:**

```java
import com.anthropic.client.AnthropicClient;
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.models.Claude;
import com.anthropic.client.okhttp.AnthropicOkHttpClient; // From Anthropic's SDK

public class DirectAnthropicAgent {
  
  private static final String CLAUDE_MODEL_ID = "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"; // Or your preferred Claude model

  public static LlmAgent createAgent() {

    // It's recommended to load sensitive keys from a secure config
    AnthropicClient anthropicClient = AnthropicOkHttpClient.builder()
        .apiKey("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
        .build();

    Claude claudeModel = new Claude(
        CLAUDE_MODEL_ID,
        anthropicClient
    );

    return LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("claude_direct_agent")
        .model(claudeModel)
        .instruction("You are a helpful AI assistant powered by Anthropic Claude.")
        // ... other LlmAgent configurations
        .build();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      LlmAgent agent = createAgent();
      System.out.println("Successfully created direct Anthropic agent: " + agent.name());
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
      System.err.println("Error creating agent: " + e.getMessage());
    }
  }
}
```



## Using Cloud & Proprietary Models via LiteLLM

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Python-blue)

To access a vast range of LLMs from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic (non-Vertex
AI), Cohere, and many others, ADK offers integration through the LiteLLM
library.

**Integration Method:** Instantiate the `LiteLlm` wrapper class and pass it to
the `model` parameter of `LlmAgent`.

**LiteLLM Overview:** [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) acts as a translation
layer, providing a standardized, OpenAI-compatible interface to over 100+ LLMs.

**Setup:**

1. **Install LiteLLM:**
        ```shell
        pip install litellm
        ```
2. **Set Provider API Keys:** Configure API keys as environment variables for
   the specific providers you intend to use.

    * *Example for OpenAI:*

        ```shell
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
        ```

    * *Example for Anthropic (non-Vertex AI):*

        ```shell
        export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
        ```

    * *Consult the
      [LiteLLM Providers Documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)
      for the correct environment variable names for other providers.*

        **Example:**

        ```python
        from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
        from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

        # --- Example Agent using OpenAI's GPT-4o ---
        # (Requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
        agent_openai = LlmAgent(
            model=LiteLlm(model="openai/gpt-4o"), # LiteLLM model string format
            name="openai_agent",
            instruction="You are a helpful assistant powered by GPT-4o.",
            # ... other agent parameters
        )

        # --- Example Agent using Anthropic's Claude Haiku (non-Vertex) ---
        # (Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
        agent_claude_direct = LlmAgent(
            model=LiteLlm(model="anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307"),
            name="claude_direct_agent",
            instruction="You are an assistant powered by Claude Haiku.",
            # ... other agent parameters
        )
        ```

!!!warning "Windows Encoding Note for LiteLLM"

    When using ADK agents with LiteLLM on Windows, you might encounter a `UnicodeDecodeError`. This error occurs because LiteLLM may attempt to read cached files using the default Windows encoding (`cp1252`) instead of UTF-8.

    To prevent this, we recommend setting the `PYTHONUTF8` environment variable to `1`. This forces Python to use UTF-8 for all file I/O.

    **Example (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    # Set for the current session
    $env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"

    # Set persistently for the user
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYTHONUTF8', '1', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
    ```


## Using Open & Local Models via LiteLLM

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Python-blue)

For maximum control, cost savings, privacy, or offline use cases, you can run
open-source models locally or self-host them and integrate them using LiteLLM.

**Integration Method:** Instantiate the `LiteLlm` wrapper class, configured to
point to your local model server.

### Ollama Integration

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) allows you to easily run open-source models
locally.

#### Model choice

If your agent is relying on tools, please make sure that you select a model with
tool support from [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).

For reliable results, we recommend using a decent-sized model with tool support.

The tool support for the model can be checked with the following command:

```bash
ollama show mistral-small3.1
  Model
    architecture        mistral3
    parameters          24.0B
    context length      131072
    embedding length    5120
    quantization        Q4_K_M

  Capabilities
    completion
    vision
    tools
```

You are supposed to see `tools` listed under capabilities.

You can also look at the template the model is using and tweak it based on your
needs.

```bash
ollama show --modelfile llama3.2 > model_file_to_modify
```

For instance, the default template for the above model inherently suggests that
the model shall call a function all the time. This may result in an infinite
loop of function calls.

```
Given the following functions, please respond with a JSON for a function call
with its proper arguments that best answers the given prompt.

Respond in the format {"name": function name, "parameters": dictionary of
argument name and its value}. Do not use variables.
```

You can swap such prompts with a more descriptive one to prevent infinite tool
call loops.

For instance:

```
Review the user's prompt and the available functions listed below.
First, determine if calling one of these functions is the most appropriate way to respond. A function call is likely needed if the prompt asks for a specific action, requires external data lookup, or involves calculations handled by the functions. If the prompt is a general question or can be answered directly, a function call is likely NOT needed.

If you determine a function call IS required: Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the format {"name": "function_name", "parameters": {"argument_name": "value"}}. Ensure parameter values are concrete, not variables.

If you determine a function call IS NOT required: Respond directly to the user's prompt in plain text, providing the answer or information requested. Do not output any JSON.
```

Then you can create a new model with the following command:

```bash
ollama create llama3.2-modified -f model_file_to_modify
```

#### Using ollama_chat provider

Our LiteLLM wrapper can be used to create agents with Ollama models.

```py
root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model="ollama_chat/mistral-small3.1"),
    name="dice_agent",
    description=(
        "hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime"
        " numbers."
    ),
    instruction="""
      You roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.
    """,
    tools=[
        roll_die,
        check_prime,
    ],
)
```

**It is important to set the provider `ollama_chat` instead of `ollama`. Using
`ollama` will result in unexpected behaviors such as infinite tool call loops
and ignoring previous context.**

While `api_base` can be provided inside LiteLLM for generation, LiteLLM library
is calling other APIs relying on the env variable instead as of v1.65.5 after
completion. So at this time, we recommend setting the env variable
`OLLAMA_API_BASE` to point to the ollama server.

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_BASE="http://localhost:11434"
adk web
```

#### Using openai provider

Alternatively, `openai` can be used as the provider name. But this will also
require setting the `OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1` and
`OPENAI_API_KEY=anything` env variables instead of `OLLAMA_API_BASE`. **Please
note that api base now has `/v1` at the end.**

```py
root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model="openai/mistral-small3.1"),
    name="dice_agent",
    description=(
        "hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime"
        " numbers."
    ),
    instruction="""
      You roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.
    """,
    tools=[
        roll_die,
        check_prime,
    ],
)
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=anything
adk web
```

#### Debugging

You can see the request sent to the Ollama server by adding the following in
your agent code just after imports.

```py
import litellm
litellm._turn_on_debug()
```

Look for a line like the following:

```bash
Request Sent from LiteLLM:
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
-d '{'model': 'mistral-small3.1', 'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': ...
```

### Self-Hosted Endpoint (e.g., vLLM)

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_in-Python-blue)

Tools such as [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) allow you to host
models efficiently and often expose an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

**Setup:**

1. **Deploy Model:** Deploy your chosen model using vLLM (or a similar tool).
   Note the API base URL (e.g., `https://your-vllm-endpoint.run.app/v1`).
    * *Important for ADK Tools:* When deploying, ensure the serving tool
      supports and enables OpenAI-compatible tool/function calling. For vLLM,
      this might involve flags like `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and potentially
      a specific `--tool-call-parser`, depending on the model. Refer to the vLLM
      documentation on Tool Use.
2. **Authentication:** Determine how your endpoint handles authentication (e.g.,
   API key, bearer token).

    **Integration Example:**

    ```python
    import subprocess
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

    # --- Example Agent using a model hosted on a vLLM endpoint ---

    # Endpoint URL provided by your vLLM deployment
    api_base_url = "https://your-vllm-endpoint.run.app/v1"

    # Model name as recognized by *your* vLLM endpoint configuration
    model_name_at_endpoint = "hosted_vllm/google/gemma-3-4b-it" # Example from vllm_test.py

    # Authentication (Example: using gcloud identity token for a Cloud Run deployment)
    # Adapt this based on your endpoint's security
    try:
        gcloud_token = subprocess.check_output(
            ["gcloud", "auth", "print-identity-token", "-q"]
        ).decode().strip()
        auth_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {gcloud_token}"}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not get gcloud token - {e}. Endpoint might be unsecured or require different auth.")
        auth_headers = None # Or handle error appropriately

    agent_vllm = LlmAgent(
        model=LiteLlm(
            model=model_name_at_endpoint,
            api_base=api_base_url,
            # Pass authentication headers if needed
            extra_headers=auth_headers
            # Alternatively, if endpoint uses an API key:
            # api_key="YOUR_ENDPOINT_API_KEY"
        ),
        name="vllm_agent",
        instruction="You are a helpful assistant running on a self-hosted vLLM endpoint.",
        # ... other agent parameters
    )
    ```

## Using Hosted & Tuned Models on Vertex AI

For enterprise-grade scalability, reliability, and integration with Google
Cloud's MLOps ecosystem, you can use models deployed to Vertex AI Endpoints.
This includes models from Model Garden or your own fine-tuned models.

**Integration Method:** Pass the full Vertex AI Endpoint resource string
(`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/endpoints/ENDPOINT_ID`) directly to the
`model` parameter of `LlmAgent`.

**Vertex AI Setup (Consolidated):**

Ensure your environment is configured for Vertex AI:

1. **Authentication:** Use Application Default Credentials (ADC):

    ```shell
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

2. **Environment Variables:** Set your project and location:

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION" # e.g., us-central1
    ```

3. **Enable Vertex Backend:** Crucially, ensure the `google-genai` library
   targets Vertex AI:

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    ```

### Model Garden Deployments

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

You can deploy various open and proprietary models from the
[Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
to an endpoint.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.genai import types # For config objects

# --- Example Agent using a Llama 3 model deployed from Model Garden ---

# Replace with your actual Vertex AI Endpoint resource name
llama3_endpoint = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/endpoints/YOUR_LLAMA3_ENDPOINT_ID"

agent_llama3_vertex = LlmAgent(
    model=llama3_endpoint,
    name="llama3_vertex_agent",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant based on Llama 3, hosted on Vertex AI.",
    generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(max_output_tokens=2048),
    # ... other agent parameters
)
```

### Fine-tuned Model Endpoints

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

Deploying your fine-tuned models (whether based on Gemini or other architectures
supported by Vertex AI) results in an endpoint that can be used directly.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

# --- Example Agent using a fine-tuned Gemini model endpoint ---

# Replace with your fine-tuned model's endpoint resource name
finetuned_gemini_endpoint = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/endpoints/YOUR_FINETUNED_ENDPOINT_ID"

agent_finetuned_gemini = LlmAgent(
    model=finetuned_gemini_endpoint,
    name="finetuned_gemini_agent",
    instruction="You are a specialized assistant trained on specific data.",
    # ... other agent parameters
)
```

### Third-Party Models on Vertex AI (e.g., Anthropic Claude)

Some providers, like Anthropic, make their models available directly through
Vertex AI.

    **Integration Method:** Uses the direct model string (e.g.,
    `"claude-3-sonnet@20240229"`), *but requires manual registration* within ADK.
    
    **Why Registration?** ADK's registry automatically recognizes `gemini-*` strings
    and standard Vertex AI endpoint strings (`projects/.../endpoints/...`) and
    routes them via the `google-genai` library. For other model types used directly
    via Vertex AI (like Claude), you must explicitly tell the ADK registry which
    specific wrapper class (`Claude` in this case) knows how to handle that model
    identifier string with the Vertex AI backend.
    
    **Setup:**
    
    1. **Vertex AI Environment:** Ensure the consolidated Vertex AI setup (ADC, Env
       Vars, `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE`) is complete.
    
    2. **Install Provider Library:** Install the necessary client library configured
       for Vertex AI.
    
        ```shell
        pip install "anthropic[vertex]"
        ```
    
    3. **Register Model Class:** Add this code near the start of your application,
       *before* creating an agent using the Claude model string:
    
        ```python
        # Required for using Claude model strings directly via Vertex AI with LlmAgent
        from google.adk.models.anthropic_llm import Claude
        from google.adk.models.registry import LLMRegistry
    
        LLMRegistry.register(Claude)
        ```
    
       **Example:**

       ```python
       from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
       from google.adk.models.anthropic_llm import Claude # Import needed for registration
       from google.adk.models.registry import LLMRegistry # Import needed for registration
       from google.genai import types
        
       # --- Register Claude class (do this once at startup) ---
       LLMRegistry.register(Claude)
        
       # --- Example Agent using Claude 3 Sonnet on Vertex AI ---
        
       # Standard model name for Claude 3 Sonnet on Vertex AI
       claude_model_vertexai = "claude-3-sonnet@20240229"
        
       agent_claude_vertexai = LlmAgent(
           model=claude_model_vertexai, # Pass the direct string after registration
           name="claude_vertexai_agent",
           instruction="You are an assistant powered by Claude 3 Sonnet on Vertex AI.",
           generate_content_config=types.GenerateContentConfig(max_output_tokens=4096),
           # ... other agent parameters
       )
       ```

=== "Java"

    **Integration Method:** Directly instantiate the provider-specific model class (e.g., `com.google.adk.models.Claude`) and configure it with a Vertex AI backend.
    
    **Why Direct Instantiation?** The Java ADK's `LlmRegistry` primarily handles Gemini models by default. For third-party models like Claude on Vertex AI, you directly provide an instance of the ADK's wrapper class (e.g., `Claude`) to the `LlmAgent`. This wrapper class is responsible for interacting with the model via its specific client library, configured for Vertex AI.
    
    **Setup:**
    
    1.  **Vertex AI Environment:**
        *   Ensure your Google Cloud project and region are correctly set up.
        *   **Application Default Credentials (ADC):** Make sure ADC is configured correctly in your environment. This is typically done by running `gcloud auth application-default login`. The Java client libraries will use these credentials to authenticate with Vertex AI. Follow the [Google Cloud Java documentation on ADC](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-auth-library/latest/com.google.auth.oauth2.GoogleCredentials#com_google_auth_oauth2_GoogleCredentials_getApplicationDefault__) for detailed setup.
    
    2.  **Provider Library Dependencies:**
        *   **Third-Party Client Libraries (Often Transitive):** The ADK core library often includes the necessary client libraries for common third-party models on Vertex AI (like Anthropic's required classes) as **transitive dependencies**. This means you might not need to explicitly add a separate dependency for the Anthropic Vertex SDK in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

    3.  **Instantiate and Configure the Model:**
        When creating your `LlmAgent`, instantiate the `Claude` class (or the equivalent for another provider) and configure its `VertexBackend`.
    
    **Example:**

    ```java
    import com.anthropic.client.AnthropicClient;
    import com.anthropic.client.okhttp.AnthropicOkHttpClient;
    import com.anthropic.vertex.backends.VertexBackend;
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.models.Claude; // ADK's wrapper for Claude
    import com.google.auth.oauth2.GoogleCredentials;
    import java.io.IOException;

    // ... other imports

    public class ClaudeVertexAiAgent {

        public static LlmAgent createAgent() throws IOException {
            // Model name for Claude 3 Sonnet on Vertex AI (or other versions)
            String claudeModelVertexAi = "claude-3-7-sonnet"; // Or any other Claude model

            // Configure the AnthropicOkHttpClient with the VertexBackend
            AnthropicClient anthropicClient = AnthropicOkHttpClient.builder()
                .backend(
                    VertexBackend.builder()
                        .region("us-east5") // Specify your Vertex AI region
                        .project("your-gcp-project-id") // Specify your GCP Project ID
                        .googleCredentials(GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault())
                        .build())
                .build();

            // Instantiate LlmAgent with the ADK Claude wrapper
            LlmAgent agentClaudeVertexAi = LlmAgent.builder()
                .model(new Claude(claudeModelVertexAi, anthropicClient)) // Pass the Claude instance
                .name("claude_vertexai_agent")
                .instruction("You are an assistant powered by Claude 3 Sonnet on Vertex AI.")
                // .generateContentConfig(...) // Optional: Add generation config if needed
                // ... other agent parameters
                .build();
            
            return agentClaudeVertexAi;
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                LlmAgent agent = createAgent();
                System.out.println("Successfully created agent: " + agent.name());
                // Here you would typically set up a Runner and Session to interact with the agent
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Failed to create agent: " + e.getMessage());
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

# Multi-Agent Systems in ADK

As agentic applications grow in complexity, structuring them as a single, monolithic agent can become challenging to develop, maintain, and reason about. The Agent Development Kit (ADK) supports building sophisticated applications by composing multiple, distinct `BaseAgent` instances into a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**.

In ADK, a multi-agent system is an application where different agents, often forming a hierarchy, collaborate or coordinate to achieve a larger goal. Structuring your application this way offers significant advantages, including enhanced modularity, specialization, reusability, maintainability, and the ability to define structured control flows using dedicated workflow agents.

You can compose various types of agents derived from `BaseAgent` to build these systems:

* **LLM Agents:** Agents powered by large language models. (See [LLM Agents](llm-agents.md))
* **Workflow Agents:** Specialized agents (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`) designed to manage the execution flow of their sub-agents. (See [Workflow Agents](workflow-agents/index.md))
* **Custom agents:** Your own agents inheriting from `BaseAgent` with specialized, non-LLM logic. (See [Custom Agents](custom-agents.md))

The following sections detail the core ADK primitives—such as agent hierarchy, workflow agents, and interaction mechanisms—that enable you to construct and manage these multi-agent systems effectively.

## 1. ADK Primitives for Agent Composition { #adk-primitives-for-agent-composition }

ADK provides core building blocks—primitives—that enable you to structure and manage interactions within your multi-agent system.

!!! Note
    The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `sub_agents` in Python, `subAgents` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### 1.1. Agent Hierarchy (Parent agent, Sub Agents) { #agent-hierarchy-parent-agent-sub-agents }

The foundation for structuring multi-agent systems is the parent-child relationship defined in `BaseAgent`.

* **Establishing Hierarchy:** You create a tree structure by passing a list of agent instances to the `sub_agents` argument when initializing a parent agent. ADK automatically sets the `parent_agent` attribute on each child agent during initialization.
* **Single Parent Rule:** An agent instance can only be added as a sub-agent once. Attempting to assign a second parent will result in a `ValueError`.
* **Importance:** This hierarchy defines the scope for [Workflow Agents](#12-workflow-agents-as-orchestrators) and influences the potential targets for LLM-Driven Delegation. You can navigate the hierarchy using `agent.parent_agent` or find descendants using `agent.find_agent(name)`.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Example: Defining Hierarchy
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent
    
    # Define individual agents
    greeter = LlmAgent(name="Greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash")
    task_doer = BaseAgent(name="TaskExecutor") # Custom non-LLM agent
    
    # Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
    coordinator = LlmAgent(
        name="Coordinator",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
        sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
            greeter,
            task_doer
        ]
    )
    
    # Framework automatically sets:
    # assert greeter.parent_agent == coordinator
    # assert task_doer.parent_agent == coordinator
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Example: Defining Hierarchy
    import com.google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    
    // Define individual agents
    LlmAgent greeter = LlmAgent.builder().name("Greeter").model("gemini-2.0-flash").build();
    SequentialAgent taskDoer = SequentialAgent.builder().name("TaskExecutor").subAgents(...).build(); // Sequential Agent
    
    // Create parent agent and assign sub_agents
    LlmAgent coordinator = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Coordinator")
        .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
        .description("I coordinate greetings and tasks")
        .subAgents(greeter, taskDoer) // Assign sub_agents here
        .build();
    
    // Framework automatically sets:
    // assert greeter.parentAgent().equals(coordinator);
    // assert taskDoer.parentAgent().equals(coordinator);
    ```

### 1.2. Workflow Agents as Orchestrators { #workflow-agents-as-orchestrators }

ADK includes specialized agents derived from `BaseAgent` that don't perform tasks themselves but orchestrate the execution flow of their `sub_agents`.

* **[`SequentialAgent`](workflow-agents/sequential-agents.md):** Executes its `sub_agents` one after another in the order they are listed.
    * **Context:** Passes the *same* [`InvocationContext`](../runtime/index.md) sequentially, allowing agents to easily pass results via shared state.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Example: Sequential Pipeline
    from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent, LlmAgent

    step1 = LlmAgent(name="Step1_Fetch", output_key="data") # Saves output to state['data']
    step2 = LlmAgent(name="Step2_Process", instruction="Process data from {data}.")

    pipeline = SequentialAgent(name="MyPipeline", sub_agents=[step1, step2])
    # When pipeline runs, Step2 can access the state['data'] set by Step1.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Example: Sequential Pipeline
    import com.google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;

    LlmAgent step1 = LlmAgent.builder().name("Step1_Fetch").outputKey("data").build(); // Saves output to state.get("data")
    LlmAgent step2 = LlmAgent.builder().name("Step2_Process").instruction("Process data from {data}.").build();

    SequentialAgent pipeline = SequentialAgent.builder().name("MyPipeline").subAgents(step1, step2).build();
    // When pipeline runs, Step2 can access the state.get("data") set by Step1.
    ```

* **[`ParallelAgent`](workflow-agents/parallel-agents.md):** Executes its `sub_agents` in parallel. Events from sub-agents may be interleaved.
    * **Context:** Modifies the `InvocationContext.branch` for each child agent (e.g., `ParentBranch.ChildName`), providing a distinct contextual path which can be useful for isolating history in some memory implementations.
    * **State:** Despite different branches, all parallel children access the *same shared* `session.state`, enabling them to read initial state and write results (use distinct keys to avoid race conditions).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Example: Parallel Execution
    from google.adk.agents import ParallelAgent, LlmAgent

    fetch_weather = LlmAgent(name="WeatherFetcher", output_key="weather")
    fetch_news = LlmAgent(name="NewsFetcher", output_key="news")

    gatherer = ParallelAgent(name="InfoGatherer", sub_agents=[fetch_weather, fetch_news])
    # When gatherer runs, WeatherFetcher and NewsFetcher run concurrently.
    # A subsequent agent could read state['weather'] and state['news'].
    ```
  
=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Example: Parallel Execution
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.ParallelAgent;
   
    LlmAgent fetchWeather = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("WeatherFetcher")
        .outputKey("weather")
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent fetchNews = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("NewsFetcher")
        .instruction("news")
        .build();
    
    ParallelAgent gatherer = ParallelAgent.builder()
        .name("InfoGatherer")
        .subAgents(fetchWeather, fetchNews)
        .build();
    
    // When gatherer runs, WeatherFetcher and NewsFetcher run concurrently.
    // A subsequent agent could read state['weather'] and state['news'].
    ```

  * **[`LoopAgent`](workflow-agents/loop-agents.md):** Executes its `sub_agents` sequentially in a loop.
      * **Termination:** The loop stops if the optional `max_iterations` is reached, or if any sub-agent returns an [`Event`](../events/index.md) with `escalate=True` in it's Event Actions.
      * **Context & State:** Passes the *same* `InvocationContext` in each iteration, allowing state changes (e.g., counters, flags) to persist across loops.

=== "Python"

      ```python
      # Conceptual Example: Loop with Condition
      from google.adk.agents import LoopAgent, LlmAgent, BaseAgent
      from google.adk.events import Event, EventActions
      from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext
      from typing import AsyncGenerator

      class CheckCondition(BaseAgent): # Custom agent to check state
          async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
              status = ctx.session.state.get("status", "pending")
              is_done = (status == "completed")
              yield Event(author=self.name, actions=EventActions(escalate=is_done)) # Escalate if done

      process_step = LlmAgent(name="ProcessingStep") # Agent that might update state['status']

      poller = LoopAgent(
          name="StatusPoller",
          max_iterations=10,
          sub_agents=[process_step, CheckCondition(name="Checker")]
      )
      # When poller runs, it executes process_step then Checker repeatedly
      # until Checker escalates (state['status'] == 'completed') or 10 iterations pass.
      ```
    
=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Example: Loop with Condition
    // Custom agent to check state and potentially escalate
    public static class CheckConditionAgent extends BaseAgent {
      public CheckConditionAgent(String name, String description) {
        super(name, description, List.of(), null, null);
      }
  
      @Override
      protected Flowable<Event> runAsyncImpl(InvocationContext ctx) {
        String status = (String) ctx.session().state().getOrDefault("status", "pending");
        boolean isDone = "completed".equalsIgnoreCase(status);

        // Emit an event that signals to escalate (exit the loop) if the condition is met.
        // If not done, the escalate flag will be false or absent, and the loop continues.
        Event checkEvent = Event.builder()
                .author(name())
                .id(Event.generateEventId()) // Important to give events unique IDs
                .actions(EventActions.builder().escalate(isDone).build()) // Escalate if done
                .build();
        return Flowable.just(checkEvent);
      }
    }
  
    // Agent that might update state.put("status")
    LlmAgent processingStepAgent = LlmAgent.builder().name("ProcessingStep").build();
    // Custom agent instance for checking the condition
    CheckConditionAgent conditionCheckerAgent = new CheckConditionAgent(
        "ConditionChecker",
        "Checks if the status is 'completed'."
    );
    LoopAgent poller = LoopAgent.builder().name("StatusPoller").maxIterations(10).subAgents(processingStepAgent, conditionCheckerAgent).build();
    // When poller runs, it executes processingStepAgent then conditionCheckerAgent repeatedly
    // until Checker escalates (state.get("status") == "completed") or 10 iterations pass.
    ```

### 1.3. Interaction & Communication Mechanisms { #interaction-communication-mechanisms }

Agents within a system often need to exchange data or trigger actions in one another. ADK facilitates this through:

#### a) Shared Session State (`session.state`)

The most fundamental way for agents operating within the same invocation (and thus sharing the same [`Session`](../sessions/session.md) object via the `InvocationContext`) to communicate passively.

* **Mechanism:** One agent (or its tool/callback) writes a value (`context.state['data_key'] = processed_data`), and a subsequent agent reads it (`data = context.state.get('data_key')`). State changes are tracked via [`CallbackContext`](../callbacks/index.md).
* **Convenience:** The `output_key` property on [`LlmAgent`](llm-agents.md) automatically saves the agent's final response text (or structured output) to the specified state key.
* **Nature:** Asynchronous, passive communication. Ideal for pipelines orchestrated by `SequentialAgent` or passing data across `LoopAgent` iterations.
* **See Also:** [State Management](../sessions/state.md)

!!! note "Invocation Context and `temp:` State"
    When a parent agent invokes a sub-agent, it passes the same `InvocationContext`. This means they share the same temporary (`temp:`) state, which is ideal for passing data that is only relevant for the current turn.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Example: Using output_key and reading state
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, SequentialAgent
    
    agent_A = LlmAgent(name="AgentA", instruction="Find the capital of France.", output_key="capital_city")
    agent_B = LlmAgent(name="AgentB", instruction="Tell me about the city stored in {capital_city}.")
    
    pipeline = SequentialAgent(name="CityInfo", sub_agents=[agent_A, agent_B])
    # AgentA runs, saves "Paris" to state['capital_city'].
    # AgentB runs, its instruction processor reads state['capital_city'] to get "Paris".
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Example: Using outputKey and reading state
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent;
    
    LlmAgent agentA = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("AgentA")
        .instruction("Find the capital of France.")
        .outputKey("capital_city")
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent agentB = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("AgentB")
        .instruction("Tell me about the city stored in {capital_city}.")
        .outputKey("capital_city")
        .build();
    
    SequentialAgent pipeline = SequentialAgent.builder().name("CityInfo").subAgents(agentA, agentB).build();
    // AgentA runs, saves "Paris" to state('capital_city').
    // AgentB runs, its instruction processor reads state.get("capital_city") to get "Paris".
    ```

#### b) LLM-Driven Delegation (Agent Transfer)

Leverages an [`LlmAgent`](llm-agents.md)'s understanding to dynamically route tasks to other suitable agents within the hierarchy.

* **Mechanism:** The agent's LLM generates a specific function call: `transfer_to_agent(agent_name='target_agent_name')`.
* **Handling:** The `AutoFlow`, used by default when sub-agents are present or transfer isn't disallowed, intercepts this call. It identifies the target agent using `root_agent.find_agent()` and updates the `InvocationContext` to switch execution focus.
* **Requires:** The calling `LlmAgent` needs clear `instructions` on when to transfer, and potential target agents need distinct `description`s for the LLM to make informed decisions. Transfer scope (parent, sub-agent, siblings) can be configured on the `LlmAgent`.
* **Nature:** Dynamic, flexible routing based on LLM interpretation.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Setup: LLM Transfer
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    
    booking_agent = LlmAgent(name="Booker", description="Handles flight and hotel bookings.")
    info_agent = LlmAgent(name="Info", description="Provides general information and answers questions.")
    
    coordinator = LlmAgent(
        name="Coordinator",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        instruction="You are an assistant. Delegate booking tasks to Booker and info requests to Info.",
        description="Main coordinator.",
        # AutoFlow is typically used implicitly here
        sub_agents=[booking_agent, info_agent]
    )
    # If coordinator receives "Book a flight", its LLM should generate:
    # FunctionCall(name='transfer_to_agent', args={'agent_name': 'Booker'})
    # ADK framework then routes execution to booking_agent.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Setup: LLM Transfer
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    
    LlmAgent bookingAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Booker")
        .description("Handles flight and hotel bookings.")
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent infoAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Info")
        .description("Provides general information and answers questions.")
        .build();
    
    // Define the coordinator agent
    LlmAgent coordinator = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Coordinator")
        .model("gemini-2.0-flash") // Or your desired model
        .instruction("You are an assistant. Delegate booking tasks to Booker and info requests to Info.")
        .description("Main coordinator.")
        // AutoFlow will be used by default (implicitly) because subAgents are present
        // and transfer is not disallowed.
        .subAgents(bookingAgent, infoAgent)
        .build();

    // If coordinator receives "Book a flight", its LLM should generate:
    // FunctionCall.builder.name("transferToAgent").args(ImmutableMap.of("agent_name", "Booker")).build()
    // ADK framework then routes execution to bookingAgent.
    ```

#### c) Explicit Invocation (`AgentTool`)

Allows an [`LlmAgent`](llm-agents.md) to treat another `BaseAgent` instance as a callable function or [Tool](../tools/index.md).

* **Mechanism:** Wrap the target agent instance in `AgentTool` and include it in the parent `LlmAgent`'s `tools` list. `AgentTool` generates a corresponding function declaration for the LLM.
* **Handling:** When the parent LLM generates a function call targeting the `AgentTool`, the framework executes `AgentTool.run_async`. This method runs the target agent, captures its final response, forwards any state/artifact changes back to the parent's context, and returns the response as the tool's result.
* **Nature:** Synchronous (within the parent's flow), explicit, controlled invocation like any other tool.
* **(Note:** `AgentTool` needs to be imported and used explicitly).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Setup: Agent as a Tool
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent
    from google.adk.tools import agent_tool
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    # Define a target agent (could be LlmAgent or custom BaseAgent)

These primitives provide the flexibility to design multi-agent interactions ranging from tightly coupled sequential workflows to dynamic, LLM-driven delegation networks.

## 2. Common Multi-Agent Patterns using ADK Primitives { #common-multi-agent-patterns-using-adk-primitives }

By combining ADK's composition primitives, you can implement various established patterns for multi-agent collaboration.

### Coordinator/Dispatcher Pattern

* **Structure:** A central [`LlmAgent`](llm-agents.md) (Coordinator) manages several specialized `sub_agents`.
* **Goal:** Route incoming requests to the appropriate specialist agent.
* **ADK Primitives Used:**
    * **Hierarchy:** Coordinator has specialists listed in `sub_agents`.
    * **Interaction:** Primarily uses **LLM-Driven Delegation** (requires clear `description`s on sub-agents and appropriate `instruction` on Coordinator) or **Explicit Invocation (`AgentTool`)** (Coordinator includes `AgentTool`-wrapped specialists in its `tools`).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Code: Coordinator using LLM Transfer
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    
    billing_agent = LlmAgent(name="Billing", description="Handles billing inquiries.")
    support_agent = LlmAgent(name="Support", description="Handles technical support requests.")
    
    coordinator = LlmAgent(
        name="HelpDeskCoordinator",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        instruction="Route user requests: Use Billing agent for payment issues, Support agent for technical problems.",
        description="Main help desk router.",
        # allow_transfer=True is often implicit with sub_agents in AutoFlow
        sub_agents=[billing_agent, support_agent]
    )
    # User asks "My payment failed" -> Coordinator's LLM should call transfer_to_agent(agent_name='Billing')
    # User asks "I can't log in" -> Coordinator's LLM should call transfer_to_agent(agent_name='Support')
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Code: Coordinator using LLM Transfer
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;

    LlmAgent billingAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Billing")
        .description("Handles billing inquiries and payment issues.")
        .build();

    LlmAgent supportAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Support")
        .description("Handles technical support requests and login problems.")
        .build();

    LlmAgent coordinator = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("HelpDeskCoordinator")
        .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
        .instruction("Route user requests: Use Billing agent for payment issues, Support agent for technical problems.")
        .description("Main help desk router.")
        .subAgents(billingAgent, supportAgent)
        // Agent transfer is implicit with sub agents in the Autoflow, unless specified
        // using .disallowTransferToParent or disallowTransferToPeers
        .build();

    // User asks "My payment failed" -> Coordinator's LLM should call
    // transferToAgent(agentName='Billing')
    // User asks "I can't log in" -> Coordinator's LLM should call
    // transferToAgent(agentName='Support')
    ```

### Sequential Pipeline Pattern

* **Structure:** A [`SequentialAgent`](workflow-agents/sequential-agents.md) contains `sub_agents` executed in a fixed order.
* **Goal:** Implement a multi-step process where the output of one step feeds into the next.
* **ADK Primitives Used:**
    * **Workflow:** `SequentialAgent` defines the order.
    * **Communication:** Primarily uses **Shared Session State**. Earlier agents write results (often via `output_key`), later agents read those results from `context.state`.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Code: Sequential Data Pipeline
    from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent, LlmAgent
    
    validator = LlmAgent(name="ValidateInput", instruction="Validate the input.", output_key="validation_status")
    processor = LlmAgent(name="ProcessData", instruction="Process data if {validation_status} is 'valid'.", output_key="result")
    reporter = LlmAgent(name="ReportResult", instruction="Report the result from {result}.")
    
    data_pipeline = SequentialAgent(
        name="DataPipeline",
        sub_agents=[validator, processor, reporter]
    )
    # validator runs -> saves to state['validation_status']
    # processor runs -> reads state['validation_status'], saves to state['result']
    # reporter runs -> reads state['result']
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Code: Sequential Data Pipeline
    import com.google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent;
    
    LlmAgent validator = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("ValidateInput")
        .instruction("Validate the input")
        .outputKey("validation_status") // Saves its main text output to session.state["validation_status"]
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent processor = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("ProcessData")
        .instruction("Process data if {validation_status} is 'valid'")
        .outputKey("result") // Saves its main text output to session.state["result"]
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent reporter = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("ReportResult")
        .instruction("Report the result from {result}")
        .build();
    
    SequentialAgent dataPipeline = SequentialAgent.builder()
        .name("DataPipeline")
        .subAgents(validator, processor, reporter)
        .build();
    
    // validator runs -> saves to state['validation_status']
    // processor runs -> reads state['validation_status'], saves to state['result']
    // reporter runs -> reads state['result']
    ```

### Parallel Fan-Out/Gather Pattern

* **Structure:** A [`ParallelAgent`](workflow-agents/parallel-agents.md) runs multiple `sub_agents` concurrently, often followed by a later agent (in a `SequentialAgent`) that aggregates results.
* **Goal:** Execute independent tasks simultaneously to reduce latency, then combine their outputs.
* **ADK Primitives Used:**
    * **Workflow:** `ParallelAgent` for concurrent execution (Fan-Out). Often nested within a `SequentialAgent` to handle the subsequent aggregation step (Gather).
    * **Communication:** Sub-agents write results to distinct keys in **Shared Session State**. The subsequent "Gather" agent reads multiple state keys.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Code: Parallel Information Gathering
    from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LlmAgent
    
    fetch_api1 = LlmAgent(name="API1Fetcher", instruction="Fetch data from API 1.", output_key="api1_data")
    fetch_api2 = LlmAgent(name="API2Fetcher", instruction="Fetch data from API 2.", output_key="api2_data")
    
    gather_concurrently = ParallelAgent(
        name="ConcurrentFetch",
        sub_agents=[fetch_api1, fetch_api2]
    )
    
    synthesizer = LlmAgent(
        name="Synthesizer",
        instruction="Combine results from {api1_data} and {api2_data}."
    )
    
    overall_workflow = SequentialAgent(
        name="FetchAndSynthesize",
        sub_agents=[gather_concurrently, synthesizer] # Run parallel fetch, then synthesize
    )
    # fetch_api1 and fetch_api2 run concurrently, saving to state.
    # synthesizer runs afterwards, reading state['api1_data'] and state['api2_data'].
    ```
=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Code: Parallel Information Gathering
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.ParallelAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent;

    LlmAgent fetchApi1 = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("API1Fetcher")
        .instruction("Fetch data from API 1.")
        .outputKey("api1_data")
        .build();

    LlmAgent fetchApi2 = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("API2Fetcher")
        .instruction("Fetch data from API 2.")
        .outputKey("api2_data")
        .build();

    ParallelAgent gatherConcurrently = ParallelAgent.builder()
        .name("ConcurrentFetcher")
        .subAgents(fetchApi2, fetchApi1)
        .build();

    LlmAgent synthesizer = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Synthesizer")

        .build();

    // fetch_api1 and fetch_api2 run concurrently, saving to state.
    // synthesizer runs afterwards, reading state['api1_data'] and state['api2_data'].
    ```


### Hierarchical Task Decomposition

* **Structure:** A multi-level tree of agents where higher-level agents break down complex goals and delegate sub-tasks to lower-level agents.
* **Goal:** Solve complex problems by recursively breaking them down into simpler, executable steps.
* **ADK Primitives Used:**
    * **Hierarchy:** Multi-level `parent_agent`/`sub_agents` structure.
    * **Interaction:** Primarily **LLM-Driven Delegation** or **Explicit Invocation (`AgentTool`)** used by parent agents to assign tasks to subagents. Results are returned up the hierarchy (via tool responses or state).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Code: Hierarchical Research Task
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.tools import agent_tool
    
    # Low-level tool-like agents
    web_searcher = LlmAgent(name="WebSearch", description="Performs web searches for facts.")
    summarizer = LlmAgent(name="Summarizer", description="Summarizes text.")
    
    # Mid-level agent combining tools
    research_assistant = LlmAgent(
        name="ResearchAssistant",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="Finds and summarizes information on a topic.",
        tools=[agent_tool.AgentTool(agent=web_searcher), agent_tool.AgentTool(agent=summarizer)]
    )
    
    # High-level agent delegating research
    report_writer = LlmAgent(
        name="ReportWriter",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        instruction="Write a report on topic X. Use the ResearchAssistant to gather information.",
        tools=[agent_tool.AgentTool(agent=research_assistant)]
        # Alternatively, could use LLM Transfer if research_assistant is a sub_agent
    )
    # User interacts with ReportWriter.
    # ReportWriter calls ResearchAssistant tool.
    # ResearchAssistant calls WebSearch and Summarizer tools.
    # Results flow back up.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Code: Hierarchical Research Task
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.tools.AgentTool;
    
    // Low-level tool-like agents
    LlmAgent webSearcher = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("WebSearch")
        .description("Performs web searches for facts.")
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent summarizer = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("Summarizer")
        .description("Summarizes text.")
        .build();
    
    // Mid-level agent combining tools
    LlmAgent researchAssistant = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("ResearchAssistant")
        .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
        .description("Finds and summarizes information on a topic.")
        .tools(AgentTool.create(webSearcher), AgentTool.create(summarizer))

        .tools(AgentTool.create(researchAssistant))
        // Alternatively, could use LLM Transfer if research_assistant is a subAgent
        .build();
    
    // User interacts with ReportWriter.
    // ReportWriter calls ResearchAssistant tool.
    // ResearchAssistant calls WebSearch and Summarizer tools.
    // Results flow back up.
    ```

### Review/Critique Pattern (Generator-Critic)

* **Structure:** Typically involves two agents within a [`SequentialAgent`](workflow-agents/sequential-agents.md): a Generator and a Critic/Reviewer.
* **Goal:** Improve the quality or validity of generated output by having a dedicated agent review it.
* **ADK Primitives Used:**
    * **Workflow:** `SequentialAgent` ensures generation happens before review.
    * **Communication:** **Shared Session State** (Generator uses `output_key` to save output; Reviewer reads that state key). The Reviewer might save its feedback to another state key for subsequent steps.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Code: Generator-Critic
    from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent, LlmAgent
    
    generator = LlmAgent(
        name="DraftWriter",
        instruction="Write a short paragraph about subject X.",
        output_key="draft_text"
    )
    
    reviewer = LlmAgent(
        name="FactChecker",
        instruction="Review the text in {draft_text} for factual accuracy. Output 'valid' or 'invalid' with reasons.",
        output_key="review_status"
    )
    
    # Optional: Further steps based on review_status
    
    review_pipeline = SequentialAgent(
        name="WriteAndReview",
        sub_agents=[generator, reviewer]
    )
    # generator runs -> saves draft to state['draft_text']
    # reviewer runs -> reads state['draft_text'], saves status to state['review_status']
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Code: Generator-Critic
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.SequentialAgent;
    
    LlmAgent generator = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("DraftWriter")
        .instruction("Write a short paragraph about subject X.")
        .outputKey("draft_text")
        .build();
    
    LlmAgent reviewer = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("FactChecker")
        .instruction("Review the text in {draft_text} for factual accuracy. Output 'valid' or 'invalid' with reasons.")
        .outputKey("review_status")
        .build();
    
    // Optional: Further steps based on review_status
    
    SequentialAgent reviewPipeline = SequentialAgent.builder()
        .name("WriteAndReview")
        .subAgents(generator, reviewer)
        .build();
    
    // generator runs -> saves draft to state['draft_text']
    // reviewer runs -> reads state['draft_text'], saves status to state['review_status']
    ```

### Iterative Refinement Pattern

* **Structure:** Uses a [`LoopAgent`](workflow-agents/loop-agents.md) containing one or more agents that work on a task over multiple iterations.
* **Goal:** Progressively improve a result (e.g., code, text, plan) stored in the session state until a quality threshold is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
* **ADK Primitives Used:**
    * **Workflow:** `LoopAgent` manages the repetition.
    * **Communication:** **Shared Session State** is essential for agents to read the previous iteration's output and save the refined version.
    * **Termination:** The loop typically ends based on `max_iterations` or a dedicated checking agent setting `escalate=True` in the `Event Actions` when the result is satisfactory.

    # Conceptual Code: Iterative Code Refinement
    from google.adk.agents import LoopAgent, LlmAgent, BaseAgent

    from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext
    from typing import AsyncGenerator
    
    # Agent to generate/refine code based on state['current_code'] and state['requirements']
    code_refiner = LlmAgent(
        name="CodeRefiner",
        instruction="Read state['current_code'] (if exists) and state['requirements']. Generate/refine Python code to meet requirements. Save to state['current_code'].",
        output_key="current_code" # Overwrites previous code in state
    )
    
    # Agent to check if the code meets quality standards
    quality_checker = LlmAgent(
        name="QualityChecker",
        instruction="Evaluate the code in state['current_code'] against state['requirements']. Output 'pass' or 'fail'.",
        output_key="quality_status"
    )
    
    # Custom agent to check the status and escalate if 'pass'
    class CheckStatusAndEscalate(BaseAgent):
        async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
            status = ctx.session.state.get("quality_status", "fail")
            should_stop = (status == "pass")
            yield Event(author=self.name, actions=EventActions(escalate=should_stop))
    
    refinement_loop = LoopAgent(
        name="CodeRefinementLoop",
        max_iterations=5,
        sub_agents=[code_refiner, quality_checker, CheckStatusAndEscalate(name="StopChecker")]
    )
    # Loop runs: Refiner -> Checker -> StopChecker
    # State['current_code'] is updated each iteration.

### Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

* **Structure:** Integrates human intervention points within an agent workflow.
* **Goal:** Allow for human oversight, approval, correction, or tasks that AI cannot perform.
* **ADK Primitives Used (Conceptual):**
    * **Interaction:** Can be implemented using a custom **Tool** that pauses execution and sends a request to an external system (e.g., a UI, ticketing system) waiting for human input. The tool then returns the human's response to the agent.
    * **Workflow:** Could use **LLM-Driven Delegation** (`transfer_to_agent`) targeting a conceptual "Human Agent" that triggers the external workflow, or use the custom tool within an `LlmAgent`.
    * **State/Callbacks:** State can hold task details for the human; callbacks can manage the interaction flow.
    * **Note:** ADK doesn't have a built-in "Human Agent" type, so this requires custom integration.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Code: Using a Tool for Human Approval
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, SequentialAgent
    from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool
    
    # --- Assume external_approval_tool exists ---
    # This tool would:
    # 1. Take details (e.g., request_id, amount, reason).
    # 2. Send these details to a human review system (e.g., via API).
    # 3. Poll or wait for the human response (approved/rejected).
    # 4. Return the human's decision.
    # async def external_approval_tool(amount: float, reason: str) -> str: ...
    approval_tool = FunctionTool(func=external_approval_tool)
    
    # Agent that prepares the request
    prepare_request = LlmAgent(
        name="PrepareApproval",
        instruction="Prepare the approval request details based on user input. Store amount and reason in state.",
        # ... likely sets state['approval_amount'] and state['approval_reason'] ...
    )
    
    # Agent that calls the human approval tool
    request_approval = LlmAgent(
        name="RequestHumanApproval",
        instruction="Use the external_approval_tool with amount from state['approval_amount'] and reason from state['approval_reason'].",
        tools=[approval_tool],
        output_key="human_decision"
    )
    
    # Agent that proceeds based on human decision
    process_decision = LlmAgent(
        name="ProcessDecision",
        instruction="Check {human_decision}. If 'approved', proceed. If 'rejected', inform user."
    )
    
    approval_workflow = SequentialAgent(
        name="HumanApprovalWorkflow",
        sub_agents=[prepare_request, request_approval, process_decision]
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual Code: Using a Tool for Human Approval
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;

    FunctionTool approvalTool = FunctionTool.create(externalApprovalTool);
    
    // Agent that prepares the request

        // ... likely sets state['approval_amount'] and state['approval_reason'] ...
        .build();
    
    // Agent that calls the human approval tool
    LlmAgent requestApproval = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("RequestHumanApproval")
        .instruction("Use the external_approval_tool with amount from state['approval_amount'] and reason from state['approval_reason'].")
        .tools(approvalTool)
        .outputKey("human_decision")
        .build();
    
    // Agent that proceeds based on human decision
    LlmAgent processDecision = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("ProcessDecision")
        .instruction("Check {human_decision}. If 'approved', proceed. If 'rejected', inform user.")
        .build();
    
    SequentialAgent approvalWorkflow = SequentialAgent.builder()
        .name("HumanApprovalWorkflow")
        .subAgents(prepareRequest, requestApproval, processDecision)
        .build();
    ```

These patterns provide starting points for structuring your multi-agent systems. You can mix and match them as needed to create the most effective architecture for your specific application.

# REST API Reference

This page provides a reference for the REST API provided by the ADK web server.
For details on using the ADK REST API in practice, see
[Testing](../../get-started/testing.md). 

!!! tip
    You can view an updated API reference on a running ADK web server by browsing 
    the `/docs` location, for example at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Endpoints

### `/run`

This endpoint executes an agent run. It takes a JSON payload with the details of the run and returns a list of events generated during the run.

**Request Body**

The request body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `app_name` (string, required): The name of the agent to run.
- `user_id` (string, required): The ID of the user.
- `session_id` (string, required): The ID of the session.
- `new_message` (Content, required): The new message to send to the agent. See the [Content](#content-object) section for more details.
- `streaming` (boolean, optional): Whether to use streaming. Defaults to `false`.
- `state_delta` (object, optional): A delta of the state to apply before the run.

**Response Body**

The response body is a JSON array of [Event](#event-object) objects.

### `/run_sse`

This endpoint executes an agent run using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. It takes the same JSON payload as the `/run` endpoint.

**Request Body**

The request body is the same as for the `/run` endpoint.

**Response Body**

The response is a stream of Server-Sent Events. Each event is a JSON object representing an [Event](#event-object).

## Objects

### `Content` object

The `Content` object represents the content of a message. It has the following structure:

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {
      "text": "..."
    }
  ],
  "role": "..."
}
```

- `parts`: A list of parts. Each part can be either text or a function call.
- `role`: The role of the author of the message (e.g., "user", "model").

### `Event` object

The `Event` object represents an event that occurred during an agent run. It has a complex structure with many optional fields. The most important fields are:

- `id`: The ID of the event.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the event.
- `author`: The author of the event.
- `content`: The content of the event.

# Artifacts

In ADK, **Artifacts** represent a crucial mechanism for managing named, versioned binary data associated either with a specific user interaction session or persistently with a user across multiple sessions. They allow your agents and tools to handle data beyond simple text strings, enabling richer interactions involving files, images, audio, and other binary formats.

!!! Note
    The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `save_artifact` in Python, `saveArtifact` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

## What are Artifacts?

*   **Definition:** An Artifact is essentially a piece of binary data (like the content of a file) identified by a unique `filename` string within a specific scope (session or user). Each time you save an artifact with the same filename, a new version is created.

*   **Representation:** Artifacts are consistently represented using the standard `google.genai.types.Part` object. The core data is typically stored within an inline data structure of the `Part` (accessed via `inline_data`), which itself contains:
    *   `data`: The raw binary content as bytes.
    *   `mime_type`: A string indicating the type of the data (e.g., `"image/png"`, `"application/pdf"`). This is essential for correctly interpreting the data later.


=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Example of how an artifact might be represented as a types.Part
    import google.genai.types as types

    # Assume 'image_bytes' contains the binary data of a PNG image
    image_bytes = b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n...' # Placeholder for actual image bytes

    image_artifact = types.Part(
        inline_data=types.Blob(
            mime_type="image/png",
            data=image_bytes
        )
    )

    # You can also use the convenience constructor:
    # image_artifact_alt = types.Part.from_bytes(data=image_bytes, mime_type="image/png")

    print(f"Artifact MIME Type: {image_artifact.inline_data.mime_type}")
    print(f"Artifact Data (first 10 bytes): {image_artifact.inline_data.data[:10]}...")
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.genai.types.Part;
    import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

    public class ArtifactExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Assume 'imageBytes' contains the binary data of a PNG image
            byte[] imageBytes = {(byte) 0x89, (byte) 0x50, (byte) 0x4E, (byte) 0x47, (byte) 0x0D, (byte) 0x0A, (byte) 0x1A, (byte) 0x0A, (byte) 0x01, (byte) 0x02}; // Placeholder for actual image bytes

            // Create an image artifact using Part.fromBytes
            Part imageArtifact = Part.fromBytes(imageBytes, "image/png");

            System.out.println("Artifact MIME Type: " + imageArtifact.inlineData().get().mimeType().get());
            System.out.println(
                "Artifact Data (first 10 bytes): "
                    + new String(imageArtifact.inlineData().get().data().get(), 0, 10, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)
                    + "...");
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Persistence & Management:** Artifacts are not stored directly within the agent or session state. Their storage and retrieval are managed by a dedicated **Artifact Service** (an implementation of `BaseArtifactService`, defined in `google.adk.artifacts`. ADK provides various implementations, such as:
    *   An in-memory service for testing or temporary storage (e.g., `InMemoryArtifactService` in Python, defined in `google.adk.artifacts.in_memory_artifact_service.py`).
    *   A service for persistent storage using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) (e.g., `GcsArtifactService` in Python, defined in `google.adk.artifacts.gcs_artifact_service.py`).
    The chosen service implementation handles versioning automatically when you save data.

## Why Use Artifacts?

While session `state` is suitable for storing small pieces of configuration or conversational context (like strings, numbers, booleans, or small dictionaries/lists), Artifacts are designed for scenarios involving binary or large data:

1. **Handling Non-Textual Data:** Easily store and retrieve images, audio clips, video snippets, PDFs, spreadsheets, or any other file format relevant to your agent's function.  
2. **Persisting Large Data:** Session state is generally not optimized for storing large amounts of data. Artifacts provide a dedicated mechanism for persisting larger blobs without cluttering the session state.  
3. **User File Management:** Provide capabilities for users to upload files (which can be saved as artifacts) and retrieve or download files generated by the agent (loaded from artifacts).  
4. **Sharing Outputs:** Enable tools or agents to generate binary outputs (like a PDF report or a generated image) that can be saved via `save_artifact` and later accessed by other parts of the application or even in subsequent sessions (if using user namespacing).  
5. **Caching Binary Data:** Store the results of computationally expensive operations that produce binary data (e.g., rendering a complex chart image) as artifacts to avoid regenerating them on subsequent requests.

In essence, whenever your agent needs to work with file-like binary data that needs to be persisted, versioned, or shared, Artifacts managed by an `ArtifactService` are the appropriate mechanism within ADK.


## Common Use Cases

Artifacts provide a flexible way to handle binary data within your ADK applications.

Here are some typical scenarios where they prove valuable:

* **Generated Reports/Files:**
    * A tool or agent generates a report (e.g., a PDF analysis, a CSV data export, an image chart).

* **Handling User Uploads:**

    * A user uploads a file (e.g., an image for analysis, a document for summarization) through a front-end interface.

* **Storing Intermediate Binary Results:**

    * An agent performs a complex multi-step process where one step generates intermediate binary data (e.g., audio synthesis, simulation results).

* **Persistent User Data:**

    * Storing user-specific configuration or data that isn't a simple key-value state.

* **Caching Generated Binary Content:**

    * An agent frequently generates the same binary output based on certain inputs (e.g., a company logo image, a standard audio greeting).



## Core Concepts

Understanding artifacts involves grasping a few key components: the service that manages them, the data structure used to hold them, and how they are identified and versioned.

### Artifact Service (`BaseArtifactService`)

* **Role:** The central component responsible for the actual storage and retrieval logic for artifacts. It defines *how* and *where* artifacts are persisted.  

* **Interface:** Defined by the abstract base class `BaseArtifactService`. Any concrete implementation must provide methods for:  

    * `Save Artifact`: Stores the artifact data and returns its assigned version number.  
    * `Load Artifact`: Retrieves a specific version (or the latest) of an artifact.  
    * `List Artifact keys`: Lists the unique filenames of artifacts within a given scope.  
    * `Delete Artifact`: Removes an artifact (and potentially all its versions, depending on implementation).  
    * `List versions`: Lists all available version numbers for a specific artifact filename.

* **Configuration:** You provide an instance of an artifact service (e.g., `InMemoryArtifactService`, `GcsArtifactService`) when initializing the `Runner`. The `Runner` then makes this service available to agents and tools via the `InvocationContext`.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from google.adk.runners import Runner
    from google.adk.artifacts import InMemoryArtifactService # Or GcsArtifactService
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent # Any agent
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService

    # Example: Configuring the Runner with an Artifact Service
    my_agent = LlmAgent(name="artifact_user_agent", model="gemini-2.0-flash")
    artifact_service = InMemoryArtifactService() # Choose an implementation
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()

    runner = Runner(
        agent=my_agent,
        app_name="my_artifact_app",
        session_service=session_service,
        artifact_service=artifact_service # Provide the service instance here
    )
    # Now, contexts within runs managed by this runner can use artifact methods
    ```

=== "Java"
    
    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.runner.Runner;
    import com.google.adk.sessions.InMemorySessionService;
    import com.google.adk.artifacts.InMemoryArtifactService;
    
    // Example: Configuring the Runner with an Artifact Service
    LlmAgent myAgent =  LlmAgent.builder()

    ```

### Artifact Data

* **Standard Representation:** Artifact content is universally represented using the `google.genai.types.Part` object, the same structure used for parts of LLM messages.  

* **Key Attribute (`inline_data`):** For artifacts, the most relevant attribute is `inline_data`, which is a `google.genai.types.Blob` object containing:  

    * `data` (`bytes`): The raw binary content of the artifact.  
    * `mime_type` (`str`): A standard MIME type string (e.g., `'application/pdf'`, `'image/png'`, `'audio/mpeg'`) describing the nature of the binary data. **This is crucial for correct interpretation when loading the artifact.**

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import google.genai.types as types

    # Example: Creating an artifact Part from raw bytes
    pdf_bytes = b'%PDF-1.4...' # Your raw PDF data
    pdf_mime_type = "application/pdf"

    # Using the constructor
    pdf_artifact_py = types.Part(
        inline_data=types.Blob(data=pdf_bytes, mime_type=pdf_mime_type)
    )

    # Using the convenience class method (equivalent)
    pdf_artifact_alt_py = types.Part.from_bytes(data=pdf_bytes, mime_type=pdf_mime_type)

    print(f"Created Python artifact with MIME type: {pdf_artifact_py.inline_data.mime_type}")
    ```
    
=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/artifacts/ArtifactDataExample.java:full_code"
    ```

### Filename

* **Identifier:** A simple string used to name and retrieve an artifact within its specific namespace.  
* **Uniqueness:** Filenames must be unique within their scope (either the session or the user namespace).  
* **Best Practice:** Use descriptive names, potentially including file extensions (e.g., `"monthly_report.pdf"`, `"user_avatar.jpg"`), although the extension itself doesn't dictate behavior – the `mime_type` does.

### Versioning

* **Automatic Versioning:** The artifact service automatically handles versioning. When you call `save_artifact`, the service determines the next available version number (typically starting from 0 and incrementing) for that specific filename and scope.  
* **Returned by `save_artifact`:** The `save_artifact` method returns the integer version number that was assigned to the newly saved artifact.  
* **Retrieval:**  
  * `load_artifact(..., version=None)` (default): Retrieves the *latest* available version of the artifact.  
  * `load_artifact(..., version=N)`: Retrieves the specific version `N`.  
* **Listing Versions:** The `list_versions` method (on the service, not context) can be used to find all existing version numbers for an artifact.

### Namespacing (Session vs. User)

* **Concept:** Artifacts can be scoped either to a specific session or more broadly to a user across all their sessions within the application. This scoping is determined by the `filename` format and handled internally by the `ArtifactService`.  

* **Default (Session Scope):** If you use a plain filename like `"report.pdf"`, the artifact is associated with the specific `app_name`, `user_id`, *and* `session_id`. It's only accessible within that exact session context.  


* **User Scope (`"user:"` prefix):** If you prefix the filename with `"user:"`, like `"user:profile.png"`, the artifact is associated only with the `app_name` and `user_id`. It can be accessed or updated from *any* session belonging to that user within the app.  


=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Example illustrating namespace difference (conceptual)

    # Session-specific artifact filename
    session_report_filename = "summary.txt"

    # User-specific artifact filename
    user_config_filename = "user:settings.json"

    # When saving 'summary.txt' via context.save_artifact,
    # it's tied to the current app_name, user_id, and session_id.

    # When saving 'user:settings.json' via context.save_artifact,
    # the ArtifactService implementation should recognize the "user:" prefix
    # and scope it to app_name and user_id, making it accessible across sessions for that user.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Example illustrating namespace difference (conceptual)
    
    // Session-specific artifact filename
    String sessionReportFilename = "summary.txt";
    
    // User-specific artifact filename
    String userConfigFilename = "user:settings.json"; // The "user:" prefix is key
    
    // When saving 'summary.txt' via context.save_artifact,
    // it's tied to the current app_name, user_id, and session_id.
    // artifactService.saveArtifact(appName, userId, sessionId1, sessionReportFilename, someData);
    
    // When saving 'user:settings.json' via context.save_artifact,
    // the ArtifactService implementation should recognize the "user:" prefix
    // and scope it to app_name and user_id, making it accessible across sessions for that user.
    // artifactService.saveArtifact(appName, userId, sessionId1, userConfigFilename, someData);
    ```

These core concepts work together to provide a flexible system for managing binary data within the ADK framework.

## Interacting with Artifacts (via Context Objects)

The primary way you interact with artifacts within your agent's logic (specifically within callbacks or tools) is through methods provided by the `CallbackContext` and `ToolContext` objects. These methods abstract away the underlying storage details managed by the `ArtifactService`.

### Prerequisite: Configuring the `ArtifactService`

Before you can use any artifact methods via the context objects, you **must** provide an instance of a [`BaseArtifactService` implementation](#available-implementations) (like [`InMemoryArtifactService`](#inmemoryartifactservice) or [`GcsArtifactService`](#gcsartifactservice)) when initializing your `Runner`.

=== "Python"

    In Python, you provide this instance when initializing your `Runner`.

    ```python
    from google.adk.runners import Runner
    from google.adk.artifacts import InMemoryArtifactService # Or GcsArtifactService
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService

    # Your agent definition
    agent = LlmAgent(name="my_agent", model="gemini-2.0-flash")

    # Instantiate the desired artifact service
    artifact_service = InMemoryArtifactService()

    # Provide it to the Runner
    runner = Runner(
        agent=agent,
        app_name="artifact_app",
        session_service=InMemorySessionService(),
        artifact_service=artifact_service # Service must be provided here
    )
    ```
    If no `artifact_service` is configured in the `InvocationContext` (which happens if it's not passed to the `Runner`), calling `save_artifact`, `load_artifact`, or `list_artifacts` on the context objects will raise a `ValueError`.

=== "Java"

    In Java, you would instantiate a `BaseArtifactService` implementation and then ensure it's accessible to the parts of your application that manage artifacts. This is often done through dependency injection or by explicitly passing the service instance.

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.artifacts.InMemoryArtifactService; // Or GcsArtifactService
    import com.google.adk.runner.Runner;
    import com.google.adk.sessions.InMemorySessionService;
    
    public class SampleArtifactAgent {
    
      public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Your agent definition
        LlmAgent agent = LlmAgent.builder()
            .name("my_agent")
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .build();
    
        // Instantiate the desired artifact service
        InMemoryArtifactService artifactService = new InMemoryArtifactService();
    
        // Provide it to the Runner
        Runner runner = new Runner(agent,
            "APP_NAME",
            artifactService, // Service must be provided here
            new InMemorySessionService());
    
      }
    }
    ```
    In Java, if an `ArtifactService` instance is not available (e.g., `null`) when artifact operations are attempted, it would typically result in a `NullPointerException` or a custom error, depending on how your application is structured. Robust applications often use dependency injection frameworks to manage service lifecycles and ensure availability.


### Accessing Methods

The artifact interaction methods are available directly on instances of `CallbackContext` (passed to agent and model callbacks) and `ToolContext` (passed to tool callbacks). Remember that `ToolContext` inherits from `CallbackContext`.

*   **Code Example:**

    === "Python"

        ```python
        import google.genai.types as types
        from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext # Or ToolContext

        async def save_generated_report_py(context: CallbackContext, report_bytes: bytes):
            """Saves generated PDF report bytes as an artifact."""
            report_artifact = types.Part.from_data(
                data=report_bytes,
                mime_type="application/pdf"
            )
            filename = "generated_report.pdf"

            try:
                version = await context.save_artifact(filename=filename, artifact=report_artifact)
                print(f"Successfully saved Python artifact '{filename}' as version {version}.")
                # The event generated after this callback will contain:
                # event.actions.artifact_delta == {"generated_report.pdf": version}
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error saving Python artifact: {e}. Is ArtifactService configured in Runner?")
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle potential storage errors (e.g., GCS permissions)
                print(f"An unexpected error occurred during Python artifact save: {e}")

        # --- Example Usage Concept (Python) ---
        # async def main_py():
        #   callback_context: CallbackContext = ... # obtain context
        #   report_data = b'...' # Assume this holds the PDF bytes
        #   await save_generated_report_py(callback_context, report_data)
        ```

    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext;
        import com.google.adk.artifacts.BaseArtifactService;
        import com.google.adk.artifacts.InMemoryArtifactService;
        import com.google.genai.types.Part;
        import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

        public class SaveArtifactExample {

        public void saveGeneratedReport(CallbackContext callbackContext, byte[] reportBytes) {
        // Saves generated PDF report bytes as an artifact.
        Part reportArtifact = Part.fromBytes(reportBytes, "application/pdf");
        String filename = "generatedReport.pdf";

            callbackContext.saveArtifact(filename, reportArtifact);
            System.out.println("Successfully saved Java artifact '" + filename);
            // The event generated after this callback will contain:
            // event().actions().artifactDelta == {"generated_report.pdf": version}
        }

        // --- Example Usage Concept (Java) ---
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            BaseArtifactService service = new InMemoryArtifactService(); // Or GcsArtifactService
            SaveArtifactExample myTool = new SaveArtifactExample();
            byte[] reportData = "...".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // PDF bytes
            CallbackContext callbackContext; // ... obtain callback context from your app
            myTool.saveGeneratedReport(callbackContext, reportData);
            // Due to async nature, in a real app, ensure program waits or handles completion.
          }
        }
        ```

#### Loading Artifacts

*   **Code Example:**

        ```python
        import google.genai.types as types
        from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext # Or ToolContext

            """Loads the latest report artifact and processes its data."""

                report_artifact = await context.load_artifact(filename=filename)

                if report_artifact and report_artifact.inline_data:
                    print(f"Successfully loaded latest Python artifact '{filename}'.")
                    print(f"MIME Type: {report_artifact.inline_data.mime_type}")
                    # Process the report_artifact.inline_data.data (bytes)
                    pdf_bytes = report_artifact.inline_data.data
                    print(f"Report size: {len(pdf_bytes)} bytes.")
                    # ... further processing ...
                else:

                # specific_version_artifact = await context.load_artifact(filename=filename, version=0)
                # if specific_version_artifact:
                #     print(f"Loaded version 0 of '{filename}'.")

            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error loading Python artifact: {e}. Is ArtifactService configured?")
            except Exception as e:

                print(f"An unexpected error occurred during Python artifact load: {e}")

#### Listing Artifact Filenames

*   **Code Example:**

    === "Python"

                                                "Error listing Java artifacts for user "

                // Due to async nature, in a real app, ensure program waits or handles completion.
            }
        }
        ```

These methods for saving, loading, and listing provide a convenient and consistent way to manage binary data persistence within ADK, whether using Python's context objects or directly interacting with the `BaseArtifactService` in Java, regardless of the chosen backend storage implementation.

## Available Implementations

ADK provides concrete implementations of the `BaseArtifactService` interface, offering different storage backends suitable for various development stages and deployment needs. These implementations handle the details of storing, versioning, and retrieving artifact data based on the `app_name`, `user_id`, `session_id`, and `filename` (including the `user:` namespace prefix).

### InMemoryArtifactService

*   **Storage Mechanism:**
    *   Python: Uses a Python dictionary (`self.artifacts`) held in the application's memory. The dictionary keys represent the artifact path, and the values are lists of `types.Part`, where each list element is a version.
    *   Java: Uses nested `HashMap` instances (`private final Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, List<Part>>>>> artifacts;`) held in memory. The keys at each level are `appName`, `userId`, `sessionId`, and `filename` respectively. The innermost `List<Part>` stores the versions of the artifact, where the list index corresponds to the version number.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Requires no external setup or dependencies beyond the core ADK library.
    *   **Speed:** Operations are typically very fast as they involve in-memory map/dictionary lookups and list manipulations.
    *   **Ephemeral:** All stored artifacts are **lost** when the application process terminates. Data does not persist between application restarts.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Ideal for local development and testing where persistence is not required.
    *   Suitable for short-lived demonstrations or scenarios where artifact data is purely temporary within a single run of the application.
*   **Instantiation:**

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from google.adk.artifacts import InMemoryArtifactService

        # Simply instantiate the class
        in_memory_service_py = InMemoryArtifactService()

        # Then pass it to the Runner
        # runner = Runner(..., artifact_service=in_memory_service_py)
        ```

    === "Java"

        ```java
        import com.google.adk.artifacts.BaseArtifactService;
        import com.google.adk.artifacts.InMemoryArtifactService;

        public class InMemoryServiceSetup {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Simply instantiate the class
                BaseArtifactService inMemoryServiceJava = new InMemoryArtifactService();

                System.out.println("InMemoryArtifactService (Java) instantiated: " + inMemoryServiceJava.getClass().getName());

                // This instance would then be provided to your Runner.
                // Runner runner = new Runner(
                //     /* other services */,
                //     inMemoryServiceJava
                // );
            }
        }
        ```

### GcsArtifactService


*   **Storage Mechanism:** Leverages Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for persistent artifact storage. Each version of an artifact is stored as a separate object (blob) within a specified GCS bucket.
*   **Object Naming Convention:** It constructs GCS object names (blob names) using a hierarchical path structure.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Persistence:** Artifacts stored in GCS persist across application restarts and deployments.
    *   **Scalability:** Leverages the scalability and durability of Google Cloud Storage.
    *   **Versioning:** Explicitly stores each version as a distinct GCS object. The `saveArtifact` method in `GcsArtifactService`.
    *   **Permissions Required:** The application environment needs appropriate credentials (e.g., Application Default Credentials) and IAM permissions to read from and write to the specified GCS bucket.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Production environments requiring persistent artifact storage.
    *   Scenarios where artifacts need to be shared across different application instances or services (by accessing the same GCS bucket).
    *   Applications needing long-term storage and retrieval of user or session data.
*   **Instantiation:**

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from google.adk.artifacts import GcsArtifactService

        # Specify the GCS bucket name
        gcs_bucket_name_py = "your-gcs-bucket-for-adk-artifacts" # Replace with your bucket name

        try:
            gcs_service_py = GcsArtifactService(bucket_name=gcs_bucket_name_py)
            print(f"Python GcsArtifactService initialized for bucket: {gcs_bucket_name_py}")
            # Ensure your environment has credentials to access this bucket.
            # e.g., via Application Default Credentials (ADC)

            # Then pass it to the Runner
            # runner = Runner(..., artifact_service=gcs_service_py)

        except Exception as e:
            # Catch potential errors during GCS client initialization (e.g., auth issues)
            print(f"Error initializing Python GcsArtifactService: {e}")
            # Handle the error appropriately - maybe fall back to InMemory or raise
        ```

    === "Java"

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/artifacts/GcsServiceSetup.java:full_code"
        ```

Choosing the appropriate `ArtifactService` implementation depends on your application's requirements for data persistence, scalability, and operational environment.

## Best Practices

To use artifacts effectively and maintainably:

* **Choose the Right Service:** Use `InMemoryArtifactService` for rapid prototyping, testing, and scenarios where persistence isn't needed. Use `GcsArtifactService` (or implement your own `BaseArtifactService` for other backends) for production environments requiring data persistence and scalability.  
* **Meaningful Filenames:** Use clear, descriptive filenames. Including relevant extensions (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.wav`) helps humans understand the content, even though the `mime_type` dictates programmatic handling. Establish conventions for temporary vs. persistent artifact names.  
* **Specify Correct MIME Types:** Always provide an accurate `mime_type` when creating the `types.Part` for `save_artifact`. This is critical for applications or tools that later `load_artifact` to interpret the `bytes` data correctly. Use standard IANA MIME types where possible.  
* **Understand Versioning:** Remember that `load_artifact()` without a specific `version` argument retrieves the *latest* version. If your logic depends on a specific historical version of an artifact, be sure to provide the integer version number when loading.  
* **Use Namespacing (`user:`) Deliberately:** Only use the `"user:"` prefix for filenames when the data truly belongs to the user and should be accessible across all their sessions. For data specific to a single conversation or session, use regular filenames without the prefix.  
* **Error Handling:**  
    * Always check if an `artifact_service` is actually configured before calling context methods (`save_artifact`, `load_artifact`, `list_artifacts`) – they will raise a `ValueError` if the service is `None`. 
    * Check the return value of `load_artifact`, as it will be `None` if the artifact or version doesn't exist. Don't assume it always returns a `Part`.  
    * Be prepared to handle exceptions from the underlying storage service, especially with `GcsArtifactService` (e.g., `google.api_core.exceptions.Forbidden` for permission issues, `NotFound` if the bucket doesn't exist, network errors).  
* **Size Considerations:** Artifacts are suitable for typical file sizes, but be mindful of potential costs and performance impacts with extremely large files, especially with cloud storage. `InMemoryArtifactService` can consume significant memory if storing many large artifacts. Evaluate if very large data might be better handled through direct GCS links or other specialized storage solutions rather than passing entire byte arrays in-memory.  
* **Cleanup Strategy:** For persistent storage like `GcsArtifactService`, artifacts remain until explicitly deleted. If artifacts represent temporary data or have a limited lifespan, implement a strategy for cleanup. This might involve:  
    * Using GCS lifecycle policies on the bucket.  
    * Building specific tools or administrative functions that utilize the `artifact_service.delete_artifact` method (note: delete is *not* exposed via context objects for safety).  
    * Carefully managing filenames to allow pattern-based deletion if needed.

# Design Patterns and Best Practices for Callbacks

Callbacks offer powerful hooks into the agent lifecycle. Here are common design patterns illustrating how to leverage them effectively in ADK, followed by best practices for implementation.

## Design Patterns

These patterns demonstrate typical ways to enhance or control agent behavior using callbacks:

### 1. Guardrails & Policy Enforcement { #guardrails-policy-enforcement }

**Pattern Overview:**
Intercept requests before they reach the LLM or tools to enforce rules.

**Implementation:**
- Use `before_model_callback` to inspect the `LlmRequest` prompt
- Use `before_tool_callback` to inspect tool arguments
- If a policy violation is detected (e.g., forbidden topics, profanity):
  - Return a predefined response (`LlmResponse` or `dict`/`Map`) to block the operation
  - Optionally update `context.state` to log the violation

**Example Use Case:**
A `before_model_callback` checks `llm_request.contents` for sensitive keywords and returns a standard "Cannot process this request" `LlmResponse` if found, preventing the LLM call.

### 2. Dynamic State Management { #dynamic-state-management }

**Pattern Overview:**
Read from and write to session state within callbacks to make agent behavior context-aware and pass data between steps.

**Implementation:**
- Access `callback_context.state` or `tool_context.state`
- Modifications (`state['key'] = value`) are automatically tracked in the subsequent `Event.actions.state_delta`
- Changes are persisted by the `SessionService`

**Example Use Case:**
An `after_tool_callback` saves a `transaction_id` from the tool's result to `tool_context.state['last_transaction_id']`. A later `before_agent_callback` might read `state['user_tier']` to customize the agent's greeting.

### 3. Logging and Monitoring { #logging-and-monitoring }

**Pattern Overview:**
Add detailed logging at specific lifecycle points for observability and debugging.

**Implementation:**
- Implement callbacks (e.g., `before_agent_callback`, `after_tool_callback`, `after_model_callback`)
- Print or send structured logs containing:
  - Agent name
  - Tool name
  - Invocation ID
  - Relevant data from the context or arguments

**Example Use Case:**
Log messages like `INFO: [Invocation: e-123] Before Tool: search_api - Args: {'query': 'ADK'}`.

### 4. Caching { #caching }

**Pattern Overview:**
Avoid redundant LLM calls or tool executions by caching results.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Before Operation:** In `before_model_callback` or `before_tool_callback`:
   - Generate a cache key based on the request/arguments
   - Check `context.state` (or an external cache) for this key
   - If found, return the cached `LlmResponse` or result directly

2. **After Operation:** If cache miss occurred:
   - Use the corresponding `after_` callback to store the new result in the cache using the key

**Example Use Case:**
`before_tool_callback` for `get_stock_price(symbol)` checks `state[f"cache:stock:{symbol}"]`. If present, returns the cached price; otherwise, allows the API call and `after_tool_callback` saves the result to the state key.

### 5. Request/Response Modification { #request-response-modification }

**Pattern Overview:**
Alter data just before it's sent to the LLM/tool or just after it's received.

**Implementation Options:**
- **`before_model_callback`:** Modify `llm_request` (e.g., add system instructions based on `state`)
- **`after_model_callback`:** Modify the returned `LlmResponse` (e.g., format text, filter content)
- **`before_tool_callback`:** Modify the tool `args` dictionary (or Map in Java)
- **`after_tool_callback`:** Modify the `tool_response` dictionary (or Map in Java)

**Example Use Case:**
`before_model_callback` appends "User language preference: Spanish" to `llm_request.config.system_instruction` if `context.state['lang'] == 'es'`.

### 6. Conditional Skipping of Steps { #conditional-skipping-of-steps }

**Pattern Overview:**
Prevent standard operations (agent run, LLM call, tool execution) based on certain conditions.

**Implementation:**
- Return a value from a `before_` callback to skip the normal execution:
  - `Content` from `before_agent_callback`
  - `LlmResponse` from `before_model_callback`
  - `dict` from `before_tool_callback`
- The framework interprets this returned value as the result for that step

**Example Use Case:**
`before_tool_callback` checks `tool_context.state['api_quota_exceeded']`. If `True`, it returns `{'error': 'API quota exceeded'}`, preventing the actual tool function from running.

### 7. Tool-Specific Actions (Authentication & Summarization Control) { #tool-specific-actions-authentication-summarization-control }

**Pattern Overview:**
Handle actions specific to the tool lifecycle, primarily authentication and controlling LLM summarization of tool results.

**Implementation:**
Use `ToolContext` within tool callbacks (`before_tool_callback`, `after_tool_callback`):

- **Authentication:** Call `tool_context.request_credential(auth_config)` in `before_tool_callback` if credentials are required but not found (e.g., via `tool_context.get_auth_response` or state check). This initiates the auth flow.
- **Summarization:** Set `tool_context.actions.skip_summarization = True` if the raw dictionary output of the tool should be passed back to the LLM or potentially displayed directly, bypassing the default LLM summarization step.

**Example Use Case:**
A `before_tool_callback` for a secure API checks for an auth token in state; if missing, it calls `request_credential`. An `after_tool_callback` for a tool returning structured JSON might set `skip_summarization = True`.

### 8. Artifact Handling { #artifact-handling }

**Pattern Overview:**
Save or load session-related files or large data blobs during the agent lifecycle.

**Implementation:**
- **Saving:** Use `callback_context.save_artifact` / `await tool_context.save_artifact` to store data:
  - Generated reports
  - Logs
  - Intermediate data
- **Loading:** Use `load_artifact` to retrieve previously stored artifacts
- **Tracking:** Changes are tracked via `Event.actions.artifact_delta`

**Example Use Case:**
An `after_tool_callback` for a "generate_report" tool saves the output file using `await tool_context.save_artifact("report.pdf", report_part)`. A `before_agent_callback` might load a configuration artifact using `callback_context.load_artifact("agent_config.json")`.

## Best Practices for Callbacks

### Design Principles

**Keep Focused:**
Design each callback for a single, well-defined purpose (e.g., just logging, just validation). Avoid monolithic callbacks.

**Mind Performance:**
Callbacks execute synchronously within the agent's processing loop. Avoid long-running or blocking operations (network calls, heavy computation). Offload if necessary, but be aware this adds complexity.

### Error Handling

**Handle Errors Gracefully:**
- Use `try...except/catch` blocks within your callback functions
- Log errors appropriately
- Decide if the agent invocation should halt or attempt recovery
- Don't let callback errors crash the entire process

### State Management

**Manage State Carefully:**
- Be deliberate about reading from and writing to `context.state`
- Changes are immediately visible within the _current_ invocation and persisted at the end of the event processing
- Use specific state keys rather than modifying broad structures to avoid unintended side effects
- Consider using state prefixes (`State.APP_PREFIX`, `State.USER_PREFIX`, `State.TEMP_PREFIX`) for clarity, especially with persistent `SessionService` implementations

### Reliability

**Consider Idempotency:**
If a callback performs actions with external side effects (e.g., incrementing an external counter), design it to be idempotent (safe to run multiple times with the same input) if possible, to handle potential retries in the framework or your application.

### Testing & Documentation

**Test Thoroughly:**
- Unit test your callback functions using mock context objects
- Perform integration tests to ensure callbacks function correctly within the full agent flow

**Ensure Clarity:**
- Use descriptive names for your callback functions
- Add clear docstrings explaining their purpose, when they run, and any side effects (especially state modifications)

**Use Correct Context Type:**
Always use the specific context type provided (`CallbackContext` for agent/model, `ToolContext` for tools) to ensure access to the appropriate methods and properties.

By applying these patterns and best practices, you can effectively use callbacks to create more robust, observable, and customized agent behaviors in ADK.

# Callbacks: Observe, Customize, and Control Agent Behavior

## Introduction: What are Callbacks and Why Use Them?

Callbacks are a cornerstone feature of ADK, providing a powerful mechanism to hook into an agent's execution process. They allow you to observe, customize, and even control the agent's behavior at specific, predefined points without modifying the core ADK framework code.

**What are they?** In essence, callbacks are standard functions that you define. You then associate these functions with an agent when you create it. The ADK framework automatically calls your functions at key stages, letting you observe or intervene. Think of it like checkpoints during the agent's process:

* **Before the agent starts its main work on a request, and after it finishes:** When you ask an agent to do something (e.g., answer a question), it runs its internal logic to figure out the response.
  * The `Before Agent` callback executes *right before* this main work begins for that specific request.
  * The `After Agent` callback executes *right after* the agent has finished all its steps for that request and has prepared the final result, but just before the result is returned.
  * This "main work" encompasses the agent's *entire* process for handling that single request. This might involve deciding to call an LLM, actually calling the LLM, deciding to use a tool, using the tool, processing the results, and finally putting together the answer. These callbacks essentially wrap the whole sequence from receiving the input to producing the final output for that one interaction.
* **Before sending a request to, or after receiving a response from, the Large Language Model (LLM):** These callbacks (`Before Model`, `After Model`) allow you to inspect or modify the data going to and coming from the LLM specifically.
* **Before executing a tool (like a Python function or another agent) or after it finishes:** Similarly, `Before Tool` and `After Tool` callbacks give you control points specifically around the execution of tools invoked by the agent.


![intro_components.png](../assets/callback_flow.png)

**Why use them?** Callbacks unlock significant flexibility and enable advanced agent capabilities:

* **Observe & Debug:** Log detailed information at critical steps for monitoring and troubleshooting.  
* **Customize & Control:** Modify data flowing through the agent (like LLM requests or tool results) or even bypass certain steps entirely based on your logic.  
* **Implement Guardrails:** Enforce safety rules, validate inputs/outputs, or prevent disallowed operations.  
* **Manage State:** Read or dynamically update the agent's session state during execution.  
* **Integrate & Enhance:** Trigger external actions (API calls, notifications) or add features like caching.

    When implementing security guardrails and policies, use ADK Plugins for
    better modularity and flexibility than Callbacks. For more details, see

        ```

## The Callback Mechanism: Interception and Control

When the ADK framework encounters a point where a callback can run (e.g., just before calling the LLM), it checks if you provided a corresponding callback function for that agent. If you did, the framework executes your function.

**Context is Key:** Your callback function isn't called in isolation. The framework provides special **context objects** (`CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`) as arguments. These objects contain vital information about the current state of the agent's execution, including the invocation details, session state, and potentially references to services like artifacts or memory. You use these context objects to understand the situation and interact with the framework. (See the dedicated "Context Objects" section for full details).

**Controlling the Flow (The Core Mechanism):** The most powerful aspect of callbacks lies in how their **return value** influences the agent's subsequent actions. This is how you intercept and control the execution flow:

1. **`return None` (Allow Default Behavior):**  

    * The specific return type can vary depending on the language. In Java, the equivalent return type is `Optional.empty()`. Refer to the API documentation for language specific guidance.
    * This is the standard way to signal that your callback has finished its work (e.g., logging, inspection, minor modifications to *mutable* input arguments like `llm_request`) and that the ADK agent should **proceed with its normal operation**.  
    * For `before_*` callbacks (`before_agent`, `before_model`, `before_tool`), returning `None` means the next step in the sequence (running the agent logic, calling the LLM, executing the tool) will occur.  
    * For `after_*` callbacks (`after_agent`, `after_model`, `after_tool`), returning `None` means the result just produced by the preceding step (the agent's output, the LLM's response, the tool's result) will be used as is.

2. **`return <Specific Object>` (Override Default Behavior):**  

    * Returning a *specific type of object* (instead of `None`) is how you **override** the ADK agent's default behavior. The framework will use the object you return and *skip* the step that would normally follow or *replace* the result that was just generated.  
    * **`before_agent_callback` → `types.Content`**: Skips the agent's main execution logic (`_run_async_impl` / `_run_live_impl`). The returned `Content` object is immediately treated as the agent's final output for this turn. Useful for handling simple requests directly or enforcing access control.  
    * **`before_model_callback` → `LlmResponse`**: Skips the call to the external Large Language Model. The returned `LlmResponse` object is processed as if it were the actual response from the LLM. Ideal for implementing input guardrails, prompt validation, or serving cached responses.  
    * **`before_tool_callback` → `dict` or `Map`**: Skips the execution of the actual tool function (or sub-agent). The returned `dict` is used as the result of the tool call, which is then typically passed back to the LLM. Perfect for validating tool arguments, applying policy restrictions, or returning mocked/cached tool results.  
    * **`after_agent_callback` → `types.Content`**: *Replaces* the `Content` that the agent's run logic just produced.  
    * **`after_model_callback` → `LlmResponse`**: *Replaces* the `LlmResponse` received from the LLM. Useful for sanitizing outputs, adding standard disclaimers, or modifying the LLM's response structure.  
    * **`after_tool_callback` → `dict` or `Map`**: *Replaces* the `dict` result returned by the tool. Allows for post-processing or standardization of tool outputs before they are sent back to the LLM.

**Conceptual Code Example (Guardrail):**

This example demonstrates the common pattern for a guardrail using `before_model_callback`.

# Types of Callbacks

The framework provides different types of callbacks that trigger at various stages of an agent's execution. Understanding when each callback fires and what context it receives is key to using them effectively.

## Agent Lifecycle Callbacks

These callbacks are available on *any* agent that inherits from `BaseAgent` (including `LlmAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc).

!!! Note
    The specific method names or return types may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., return `None` in Python, return `Optional.empty()` or `Maybe.empty()` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Before Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately before* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method is executed. It runs after the agent's `InvocationContext` is created but *before* its core logic begins.

**Purpose:** Ideal for setting up resources or state needed only for this specific agent's run, performing validation checks on the session state (callback\_context.state) before execution starts, logging the entry point of the agent's activity, or potentially modifying the invocation context before the core logic uses it.


??? "Code"
    === "Python"
    
        ```python
        --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/callbacks/before_agent_callback.py"
        ```
    
    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/BeforeAgentCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```


**Note on the `before_agent_callback` Example:**

* **What it Shows:** This example demonstrates the `before_agent_callback`. This callback runs *right before* the agent's main processing logic starts for a given request.
* **How it Works:** The callback function (`check_if_agent_should_run`) looks at a flag (`skip_llm_agent`) in the session's state.
    * If the flag is `True`, the callback returns a `types.Content` object. This tells the ADK framework to **skip** the agent's main execution entirely and use the callback's returned content as the final response.
    * If the flag is `False` (or not set), the callback returns `None` or an empty object. This tells the ADK framework to **proceed** with the agent's normal execution (calling the LLM in this case).
* **Expected Outcome:** You'll see two scenarios:
    1. In the session *with* the `skip_llm_agent: True` state, the agent's LLM call is bypassed, and the output comes directly from the callback ("Agent... skipped...").
    2. In the session *without* that state flag, the callback allows the agent to run, and you see the actual response from the LLM (e.g., "Hello!").
* **Understanding Callbacks:** This highlights how `before_` callbacks act as **gatekeepers**, allowing you to intercept execution *before* a major step and potentially prevent it based on checks (like state, input validation, permissions).


### After Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately after* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method successfully completes. It does *not* run if the agent was skipped due to `before_agent_callback` returning content or if `end_invocation` was set during the agent's run.

**Purpose:** Useful for cleanup tasks, post-execution validation, logging the completion of an agent's activity, modifying final state, or augmenting/replacing the agent's final output.

??? "Code"
    === "Python"
    
        ```python

    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/AfterAgentCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```


**Note on the `after_agent_callback` Example:**

* **What it Shows:** This example demonstrates the `after_agent_callback`. This callback runs *right after* the agent's main processing logic has finished and produced its result, but *before* that result is finalized and returned.
* **How it Works:** The callback function (`modify_output_after_agent`) checks a flag (`add_concluding_note`) in the session's state.
    * If the flag is `True`, the callback returns a *new* `types.Content` object. This tells the ADK framework to **replace** the agent's original output with the content returned by the callback.
    * If the flag is `False` (or not set), the callback returns `None` or an empty object. This tells the ADK framework to **use** the original output generated by the agent.
*   **Expected Outcome:** You'll see two scenarios:
    1. In the session *without* the `add_concluding_note: True` state, the callback allows the agent's original output ("Processing complete!") to be used.
    2. In the session *with* that state flag, the callback intercepts the agent's original output and replaces it with its own message ("Concluding note added...").
* **Understanding Callbacks:** This highlights how `after_` callbacks allow **post-processing** or **modification**. You can inspect the result of a step (the agent's run) and decide whether to let it pass through, change it, or completely replace it based on your logic.

## LLM Interaction Callbacks

These callbacks are specific to `LlmAgent` and provide hooks around the interaction with the Large Language Model.

### Before Model Callback

**When:** Called just before the `generate_content_async` (or equivalent) request is sent to the LLM within an `LlmAgent`'s flow.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the request going to the LLM. Use cases include adding dynamic instructions, injecting few-shot examples based on state, modifying model config, implementing guardrails (like profanity filters), or implementing request-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**  
If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the LLM continues its normal workflow. If the callback returns an `LlmResponse` object, then the call to the LLM is **skipped**. The returned `LlmResponse` is used directly as if it came from the model. This is powerful for implementing guardrails or caching.

    === "Python"

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/BeforeModelCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```

### After Model Callback

**When:** Called just after a response (`LlmResponse`) is received from the LLM, before it's processed further by the invoking agent.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection or modification of the raw LLM response. Use cases include

* logging model outputs,
* reformatting responses,
* censoring sensitive information generated by the model,
* parsing structured data from the LLM response and storing it in `callback_context.state`
* or handling specific error codes.

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/AfterModelCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```

## Tool Execution Callbacks

These callbacks are also specific to `LlmAgent` and trigger around the execution of tools (including `FunctionTool`, `AgentTool`, etc.) that the LLM might request.

### Before Tool Callback

**When:** Called just before a specific tool's `run_async` method is invoked, after the LLM has generated a function call for it.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of tool arguments, performing authorization checks before execution, logging tool usage attempts, or implementing tool-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the tool's `run_async` method is executed with the (potentially modified) `args`.  
2. If a dictionary (or `Map` in Java) is returned, the tool's `run_async` method is **skipped**. The returned dictionary is used directly as the result of the tool call. This is useful for caching or overriding tool behavior.

    === "Python"
    
        ```python

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/callbacks/BeforeToolCallbackExample.java:init"
        ```



### After Tool Callback

**When:** Called just after the tool's `run_async` method completes successfully.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the tool's result before it's sent back to the LLM (potentially after summarization). Useful for logging tool results, post-processing or formatting results, or saving specific parts of the result to the session state.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the original `tool_response` is used.  
2. If a new dictionary is returned, it **replaces** the original `tool_response`. This allows modifying or filtering the result seen by the LLM.

# Context

## What are Context

In the Agent Development Kit (ADK), "context" refers to the crucial bundle of information available to your agent and its tools during specific operations. Think of it as the necessary background knowledge and resources needed to handle a current task or conversation turn effectively.

Agents often need more than just the latest user message to perform well. Context is essential because it enables:

1. **Maintaining State:** Remembering details across multiple steps in a conversation (e.g., user preferences, previous calculations, items in a shopping cart). This is primarily managed through **session state**.
2. **Passing Data:** Sharing information discovered or generated in one step (like an LLM call or a tool execution) with subsequent steps. Session state is key here too.
3. **Accessing Services:** Interacting with framework capabilities like:
    * **Artifact Storage:** Saving or loading files or data blobs (like PDFs, images, configuration files) associated with the session.
    * **Memory:** Searching for relevant information from past interactions or external knowledge sources connected to the user.
    * **Authentication:** Requesting and retrieving credentials needed by tools to access external APIs securely.
4. **Identity and Tracking:** Knowing which agent is currently running (`agent.name`) and uniquely identifying the current request-response cycle (`invocation_id`) for logging and debugging.
5. **Tool-Specific Actions:** Enabling specialized operations within tools, such as requesting authentication or searching memory, which require access to the current interaction's details.


The central piece holding all this information together for a single, complete user-request-to-final-response cycle (an **invocation**) is the `InvocationContext`. However, you typically won't create or manage this object directly. The ADK framework creates it when an invocation starts (e.g., via `runner.run_async`) and passes the relevant contextual information implicitly to your agent code, callbacks, and tools.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Conceptual Pseudocode: How the framework provides context (Internal Logic)
    
    # runner = Runner(agent=my_root_agent, session_service=..., artifact_service=...)
    # user_message = types.Content(...)
    # session = session_service.get_session(...) # Or create new
    
    # --- Inside runner.run_async(...) ---
    # 1. Framework creates the main context for this specific run
    # invocation_context = InvocationContext(
    #     invocation_id="unique-id-for-this-run",
    #     session=session,
    #     user_content=user_message,
    #     agent=my_root_agent, # The starting agent
    #     session_service=session_service,
    #     artifact_service=artifact_service,
    #     memory_service=memory_service,
    #     # ... other necessary fields ...
    # )
    #
    # 2. Framework calls the agent's run method, passing the context implicitly
    #    (The agent's method signature will receive it, e.g., runAsyncImpl(InvocationContext invocationContext))
    # await my_root_agent.run_async(invocation_context)
    #   --- End Internal Logic ---
    #
    # As a developer, you work with the context objects provided in method arguments.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    /* Conceptual Pseudocode: How the framework provides context (Internal Logic) */
    InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(agent);
    Session session = runner
        .sessionService()
        .createSession(runner.appName(), USER_ID, initialState, SESSION_ID )
        .blockingGet();

    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
      while (true) {
        System.out.print("\nYou > ");
      }
      String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
      if ("quit".equalsIgnoreCase(userInput)) {
        break;
      }
      Content userMsg = Content.fromParts(Part.fromText(userInput));
      Flowable<Event> events = runner.runAsync(session.userId(), session.id(), userMsg);
      System.out.print("\nAgent > ");
      events.blockingForEach(event -> System.out.print(event.stringifyContent()));
    }
    ```

## The Different types of Context

While `InvocationContext` acts as the comprehensive internal container, ADK provides specialized context objects tailored to specific situations. This ensures you have the right tools and permissions for the task at hand without needing to handle the full complexity of the internal context everywhere. Here are the different "flavors" you'll encounter:

1.  **`InvocationContext`**
    *   **Where Used:** Received as the `ctx` argument directly within an agent's core implementation methods (`_run_async_impl`, `_run_live_impl`).
    *   **Purpose:** Provides access to the *entire* state of the current invocation. This is the most comprehensive context object.
    *   **Key Contents:** Direct access to `session` (including `state` and `events`), the current `agent` instance, `invocation_id`, initial `user_content`, references to configured services (`artifact_service`, `memory_service`, `session_service`), and fields related to live/streaming modes.
    *   **Use Case:** Primarily used when the agent's core logic needs direct access to the overall session or services, though often state and artifact interactions are delegated to callbacks/tools which use their own contexts. Also used to control the invocation itself (e.g., setting `ctx.end_invocation = True`).

        class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
            async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
                # Direct access example
                agent_name = ctx.agent.name
                session_id = ctx.session.id
                print(f"Agent {agent_name} running in session {session_id} for invocation {ctx.invocation_id}")

                // ... agent logic using ctx ...
            }
        ```

2.  **`ReadonlyContext`**
    *   **Where Used:** Provided in scenarios where only read access to basic information is needed and mutation is disallowed (e.g., `InstructionProvider` functions). It's also the base class for other contexts.
    *   **Purpose:** Offers a safe, read-only view of fundamental contextual details.
    *   **Key Contents:** `invocation_id`, `agent_name`, and a read-only *view* of the current `state`.

            user_tier = context.state().get("user_tier", "standard") # Can read state
            # context.state['new_key'] = 'value' # This would typically cause an error or be ineffective

            // Read-only access example
            String userTier = context.state().get("user_tier", "standard");
            context.state().put('new_key', 'value'); //This would typically cause an error
            return "Process the request for a " + userTier + " user."
        }
        ```
    
3.  **`CallbackContext`**
    *   **Where Used:** Passed as `callback_context` to agent lifecycle callbacks (`before_agent_callback`, `after_agent_callback`) and model interaction callbacks (`before_model_callback`, `after_model_callback`).
    *   **Purpose:** Facilitates inspecting and modifying state, interacting with artifacts, and accessing invocation details *specifically within callbacks*.
    *   **Key Capabilities (Adds to `ReadonlyContext`):**
        *   **Mutable `state` Property:** Allows reading *and writing* to session state. Changes made here (`callback_context.state['key'] = value`) are tracked and associated with the event generated by the framework after the callback.
        *   **Artifact Methods:** `load_artifact(filename)` and `save_artifact(filename, part)` methods for interacting with the configured `artifact_service`.
        *   Direct `user_content` access.

        ```python
        # Pseudocode: Callback receiving CallbackContext
        from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext
        from google.adk.models import LlmRequest
        from google.genai import types
        from typing import Optional
    
        def my_before_model_cb(callback_context: CallbackContext, request: LlmRequest) -> Optional[types.Content]:
            # Read/Write state example
            call_count = callback_context.state.get("model_calls", 0)
            callback_context.state["model_calls"] = call_count + 1 # Modify state
    
            # Optionally load an artifact
            # config_part = callback_context.load_artifact("model_config.json")
            print(f"Preparing model call #{call_count + 1} for invocation {callback_context.invocation_id}")
            return None # Allow model call to proceed
        ```

        // Pseudocode: Callback receiving CallbackContext
        import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext;
        import com.google.adk.models.LlmRequest;
        import com.google.genai.types.Content;
        import java.util.Optional;
    
        public Maybe<LlmResponse> myBeforeModelCb(CallbackContext callbackContext, LlmRequest request){
            // Read/Write state example
            callCount = callbackContext.state().get("model_calls", 0)
            callbackContext.state().put("model_calls") = callCount + 1 # Modify state
    
            // Optionally load an artifact

            return Maybe.empty(); // Allow model call to proceed
        }
        ```

4.  **`ToolContext`**
    *   **Where Used:** Passed as `tool_context` to the functions backing `FunctionTool`s and to tool execution callbacks (`before_tool_callback`, `after_tool_callback`).
    *   **Purpose:** Provides everything `CallbackContext` does, plus specialized methods essential for tool execution, like handling authentication, searching memory, and listing artifacts.
    *   **Key Capabilities (Adds to `CallbackContext`):**
        *   **Authentication Methods:** `request_credential(auth_config)` to trigger an auth flow, and `get_auth_response(auth_config)` to retrieve credentials provided by the user/system.
        *   **Artifact Listing:** `list_artifacts()` to discover available artifacts in the session.
        *   **Memory Search:** `search_memory(query)` to query the configured `memory_service`.
        *   **`function_call_id` Property:** Identifies the specific function call from the LLM that triggered this tool execution, crucial for linking authentication requests or responses back correctly.
        *   **`actions` Property:** Direct access to the `EventActions` object for this step, allowing the tool to signal state changes, auth requests, etc.

    === "Python"
    
        ```python
        # Pseudocode: Tool function receiving ToolContext
        from google.adk.tools import ToolContext
        from typing import Dict, Any
    
        # Assume this function is wrapped by a FunctionTool
        def search_external_api(query: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            api_key = tool_context.state.get("api_key")
            if not api_key:
                # Define required auth config
                # auth_config = AuthConfig(...)
                # tool_context.request_credential(auth_config) # Request credentials
                # Use the 'actions' property to signal the auth request has been made
                # tool_context.actions.requested_auth_configs[tool_context.function_call_id] = auth_config

            # available_files = tool_context.list_artifacts()
    
            return {"result": f"Data for {query} fetched."}
        ```

        import java.util.HashMap;
        import java.util.Map;
    
        // Assume this function is wrapped by a FunctionTool
        public Map<String, Object> searchExternalApi(String query, ToolContext toolContext){
            String apiKey = toolContext.state.get("api_key");
            if(apiKey.isEmpty()){
                // Define required auth config
                // authConfig = AuthConfig(...);
                // toolContext.requestCredential(authConfig); # Request credentials
                // Use the 'actions' property to signal the auth request has been made
                ...
                return Map.of("status", "Auth Required");
    
            // Use the API key...
            System.out.println("Tool executing for query " + query + " using API key. ");
    
            // Optionally list artifacts
            // Single<List<String>> availableFiles = toolContext.listArtifacts();

        }

Understanding these different context objects and when to use them is key to effectively managing state, accessing services, and controlling the flow of your ADK application. The next section will detail common tasks you can perform using these contexts.


## Common Tasks Using Context

Now that you understand the different context objects, let's focus on how to use them for common tasks when building your agents and tools.

### Accessing Information

You'll frequently need to read information stored within the context.

*   **Reading Session State:** Access data saved in previous steps or user/app-level settings. Use dictionary-like access on the `state` property.

    === "Python"
    
        ```python
        # Pseudocode: In a Tool function
        from google.adk.tools import ToolContext
    
        def my_tool(tool_context: ToolContext, **kwargs):
            user_pref = tool_context.state.get("user_display_preference", "default_mode")
            api_endpoint = tool_context.state.get("app:api_endpoint") # Read app-level state
    
            if user_pref == "dark_mode":
                # ... apply dark mode logic ...
                pass
            print(f"Using API endpoint: {api_endpoint}")
            # ... rest of tool logic ...
    
        # Pseudocode: In a Callback function
        from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext
    
        def my_callback(callback_context: CallbackContext, **kwargs):
            last_tool_result = callback_context.state.get("temp:last_api_result") # Read temporary state
            if last_tool_result:
                print(f"Found temporary result from last tool: {last_tool_result}")
            # ... callback logic ...
        ```
    
    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        // Pseudocode: In a Tool function
        import com.google.adk.tools.ToolContext;
    
        public void myTool(ToolContext toolContext){
           String userPref = toolContext.state().get("user_display_preference");
           String apiEndpoint = toolContext.state().get("app:api_endpoint"); // Read app-level state
           if(userPref.equals("dark_mode")){
                // ... apply dark mode logic ...
                pass
            }
           System.out.println("Using API endpoint: " + api_endpoint);
           // ... rest of tool logic ...
        }
    
    
        // Pseudocode: In a Callback function
        import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext;
    
            public void myCallback(CallbackContext callbackContext){
                String lastToolResult = (String) callbackContext.state().get("temp:last_api_result"); // Read temporary state
            }
            if(!(lastToolResult.isEmpty())){
                System.out.println("Found temporary result from last tool: " + lastToolResult);
            }
            // ... callback logic ...
        ```

*   **Getting Current Identifiers:** Useful for logging or custom logic based on the current operation.

    === "Python"
    
        ```python
        # Pseudocode: In any context (ToolContext shown)
        from google.adk.tools import ToolContext
    
        def log_tool_usage(tool_context: ToolContext, **kwargs):
            agent_name = tool_context.agent_nameSystem.out.println("Found temporary result from last tool: " + lastToolResult);
            inv_id = tool_context.invocation_id
            func_call_id = getattr(tool_context, 'function_call_id', 'N/A') # Specific to ToolContext
    
            print(f"Log: Invocation={inv_id}, Agent={agent_name}, FunctionCallID={func_call_id} - Tool Executed.")
        ```
    
    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        // Pseudocode: In any context (ToolContext shown)
         import com.google.adk.tools.ToolContext;
    
         public void logToolUsage(ToolContext toolContext){
                    String agentName = toolContext.agentName;
                    String invId = toolContext.invocationId;
                    String functionCallId = toolContext.functionCallId().get(); // Specific to ToolContext
                    System.out.println("Log: Invocation= " + invId &+ " Agent= " + agentName);
                }
        ```

*   **Accessing the Initial User Input:** Refer back to the message that started the current invocation.

    === "Python"
    
        ```python
        # Pseudocode: In a Callback
        from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext
    
        def check_initial_intent(callback_context: CallbackContext, **kwargs):
            initial_text = "N/A"
            if callback_context.user_content and callback_context.user_content.parts:
                initial_text = callback_context.user_content.parts[0].text or "Non-text input"
    
            print(f"This invocation started with user input: '{initial_text}'")
    
        # Pseudocode: In an Agent's _run_async_impl
        # async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
        #     if ctx.user_content and ctx.user_content.parts:
        #         initial_text = ctx.user_content.parts[0].text
        #         print(f"Agent logic remembering initial query: {initial_text}")
        #     ...
        ```
    
    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        // Pseudocode: In a Callback
        import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext;
    
        public void checkInitialIntent(CallbackContext callbackContext){
            String initialText = "N/A";
            if((!(callbackContext.userContent().isEmpty())) && (!(callbackContext.userContent().parts.isEmpty()))){
                initialText = cbx.userContent().get().parts().get().get(0).text().get();
                ...
                System.out.println("This invocation started with user input: " + initialText)
            }
        }
        ```
    
### Managing State

State is crucial for memory and data flow. When you modify state using `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`, the changes are automatically tracked and persisted by the framework.

*   **How it Works:** Writing to `callback_context.state['my_key'] = my_value` or `tool_context.state['my_key'] = my_value` adds this change to the `EventActions.state_delta` associated with the current step's event. The `SessionService` then applies these deltas when persisting the event.

*  **Passing Data Between Tools**

    === "Python"

        ```python
        # Pseudocode: Tool 1 - Fetches user ID
        from google.adk.tools import ToolContext
        import uuid
    
        def get_user_profile(tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
            user_id = str(uuid.uuid4()) # Simulate fetching ID
            # Save the ID to state for the next tool
            tool_context.state["temp:current_user_id"] = user_id
            return {"profile_status": "ID generated"}
    
        # Pseudocode: Tool 2 - Uses user ID from state
        def get_user_orders(tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
            user_id = tool_context.state.get("temp:current_user_id")
            if not user_id:
                return {"error": "User ID not found in state"}
    
            print(f"Fetching orders for user ID: {user_id}")
            # ... logic to fetch orders using user_id ...
            return {"orders": ["order123", "order456"]}
        ```

    === "Java"

        ```java
        // Pseudocode: Tool 1 - Fetches user ID
        import com.google.adk.tools.ToolContext;
        import java.util.UUID;
    
        public Map<String, String> getUserProfile(ToolContext toolContext){
            String userId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
            // Save the ID to state for the next tool
            toolContext.state().put("temp:current_user_id", user_id);
            return Map.of("profile_status", "ID generated");
        }
    
        // Pseudocode: Tool 2 - Uses user ID from state
        public  Map<String, String> getUserOrders(ToolContext toolContext){
            String userId = toolContext.state().get("temp:current_user_id");
            if(userId.isEmpty()){
                return Map.of("error", "User ID not found in state");
            }
            System.out.println("Fetching orders for user id: " + userId);
             // ... logic to fetch orders using user_id ...
            return Map.of("orders", "order123");
        }
        ```

*   **Updating User Preferences:**

    === "Python"
    
        ```python
        # Pseudocode: Tool or Callback identifies a preference
        from google.adk.tools import ToolContext # Or CallbackContext
    
        def set_user_preference(tool_context: ToolContext, preference: str, value: str) -> dict:
            # Use 'user:' prefix for user-level state (if using a persistent SessionService)
            state_key = f"user:{preference}"
            tool_context.state[state_key] = value
            print(f"Set user preference '{preference}' to '{value}'")
            return {"status": "Preference updated"}
        ```
    
    === "Java"
    
        ```java
        // Pseudocode: Tool or Callback identifies a preference
        import com.google.adk.tools.ToolContext; // Or CallbackContext
    
        public Map<String, String> setUserPreference(ToolContext toolContext, String preference, String value){
            // Use 'user:' prefix for user-level state (if using a persistent SessionService)
            String stateKey = "user:" + preference;
            toolContext.state().put(stateKey, value);
            System.out.println("Set user preference '" + preference + "' to '" + value + "'");
            return Map.of("status", "Preference updated");
        }
        ```

*   **State Prefixes:** While basic state is session-specific, prefixes like `app:` and `user:` can be used with persistent `SessionService` implementations (like `DatabaseSessionService` or `VertexAiSessionService`) to indicate broader scope (app-wide or user-wide across sessions). `temp:` can denote data only relevant within the current invocation.

### Working with Artifacts

Use artifacts to handle files or large data blobs associated with the session. Common use case: processing uploaded documents.

*   **Document Summarizer Example Flow:**

    1.  **Ingest Reference (e.g., in a Setup Tool or Callback):** Save the *path or URI* of the document, not the entire content, as an artifact.

        === "Python"
    
               ```python
               # Pseudocode: In a callback or initial tool
               from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext # Or ToolContext
               from google.genai import types
                
               def save_document_reference(context: CallbackContext, file_path: str) -> None:
                   # Assume file_path is something like "gs://my-bucket/docs/report.pdf" or "/local/path/to/report.pdf"
                   try:
                       # Create a Part containing the path/URI text
                       artifact_part = types.Part(text=file_path)
                       version = context.save_artifact("document_to_summarize.txt", artifact_part)
                       print(f"Saved document reference '{file_path}' as artifact version {version}")
                       # Store the filename in state if needed by other tools
                       context.state["temp:doc_artifact_name"] = "document_to_summarize.txt"
                   except ValueError as e:
                       print(f"Error saving artifact: {e}") # E.g., Artifact service not configured
                   except Exception as e:
                       print(f"Unexpected error saving artifact reference: {e}")
                
               # Example usage:
               # save_document_reference(callback_context, "gs://my-bucket/docs/report.pdf")
               ```
    
        === "Java"
    
               ```java
               // Pseudocode: In a callback or initial tool
               import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext;
               import com.google.genai.types.Content;
               import com.google.genai.types.Part;
                
                
               pubic void saveDocumentReference(CallbackContext context, String filePath){
                   // Assume file_path is something like "gs://my-bucket/docs/report.pdf" or "/local/path/to/report.pdf"
                   try{
                       // Create a Part containing the path/URI text
                       Part artifactPart = types.Part(filePath)
                       Optional<Integer> version = context.saveArtifact("document_to_summarize.txt", artifactPart)
                       System.out.println("Saved document reference" + filePath + " as artifact version " + version);
                       // Store the filename in state if needed by other tools
                       context.state().put("temp:doc_artifact_name", "document_to_summarize.txt");
                   } catch(Exception e){
                       System.out.println("Unexpected error saving artifact reference: " + e);
                   }
               }
                    
               // Example usage:
               // saveDocumentReference(context, "gs://my-bucket/docs/report.pdf")
               ```

    2.  **Summarizer Tool:** Load the artifact to get the path/URI, read the actual document content using appropriate libraries, summarize, and return the result.

        === "Python"

            ```python
            # Pseudocode: In the Summarizer tool function
            from google.adk.tools import ToolContext
            from google.genai import types

### Handling Tool Authentication 

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

Securely manage API keys or other credentials needed by tools.

```python
# Pseudocode: Tool requiring auth
from google.adk.tools import ToolContext
from google.adk.auth import AuthConfig # Assume appropriate AuthConfig is defined

# Define your required auth configuration (e.g., OAuth, API Key)
MY_API_AUTH_CONFIG = AuthConfig(...)
AUTH_STATE_KEY = "user:my_api_credential" # Key to store retrieved credential

def call_secure_api(tool_context: ToolContext, request_data: str) -> dict:
    # 1. Check if credential already exists in state
    credential = tool_context.state.get(AUTH_STATE_KEY)

    if not credential:
        # 2. If not, request it
        print("Credential not found, requesting...")
        try:
            tool_context.request_credential(MY_API_AUTH_CONFIG)
            # The framework handles yielding the event. The tool execution stops here for this turn.
            return {"status": "Authentication required. Please provide credentials."}
        except ValueError as e:
            return {"error": f"Auth error: {e}"} # e.g., function_call_id missing
        except Exception as e:
            return {"error": f"Failed to request credential: {e}"}

    # 3. If credential exists (might be from a previous turn after request)
    #    or if this is a subsequent call after auth flow completed externally
    try:
        # Optionally, re-validate/retrieve if needed, or use directly
        # This might retrieve the credential if the external flow just completed
        auth_credential_obj = tool_context.get_auth_response(MY_API_AUTH_CONFIG)
        api_key = auth_credential_obj.api_key # Or access_token, etc.

        # Store it back in state for future calls within the session
        tool_context.state[AUTH_STATE_KEY] = auth_credential_obj.model_dump() # Persist retrieved credential

        print(f"Using retrieved credential to call API with data: {request_data}")
        # ... Make the actual API call using api_key ...
        api_result = f"API result for {request_data}"

        return {"result": api_result}
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle errors retrieving/using the credential
        print(f"Error using credential: {e}")
        # Maybe clear the state key if credential is invalid?
        # tool_context.state[AUTH_STATE_KEY] = None
        return {"error": "Failed to use credential"}

```
*Remember: `request_credential` pauses the tool and signals the need for authentication. The user/system provides credentials, and on a subsequent call, `get_auth_response` (or checking state again) allows the tool to proceed.* The `tool_context.function_call_id` is used implicitly by the framework to link the request and response.

### Leveraging Memory 

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

Access relevant information from the past or external sources.

```python
# Pseudocode: Tool using memory search
from google.adk.tools import ToolContext

def find_related_info(tool_context: ToolContext, topic: str) -> dict:
    try:
        search_results = tool_context.search_memory(f"Information about {topic}")
        if search_results.results:
            print(f"Found {len(search_results.results)} memory results for '{topic}'")
            # Process search_results.results (which are SearchMemoryResponseEntry)
            top_result_text = search_results.results[0].text
            return {"memory_snippet": top_result_text}
        else:
            return {"message": "No relevant memories found."}
    except ValueError as e:
        return {"error": f"Memory service error: {e}"} # e.g., Service not configured
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Unexpected error searching memory: {e}"}
```

### Advanced: Direct `InvocationContext` Usage 

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

While most interactions happen via `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`, sometimes the agent's core logic (`_run_async_impl`/`_run_live_impl`) needs direct access.

```python
# Pseudocode: Inside agent's _run_async_impl
from google.adk.agents import BaseAgent
from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext
from google.adk.events import Event
from typing import AsyncGenerator

class MyControllingAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
        # Example: Check if a specific service is available
        if not ctx.memory_service:
            print("Memory service is not available for this invocation.")
            # Potentially change agent behavior

        # Example: Early termination based on some condition
        if ctx.session.state.get("critical_error_flag"):
            print("Critical error detected, ending invocation.")
            ctx.end_invocation = True # Signal framework to stop processing
            yield Event(author=self.name, invocation_id=ctx.invocation_id, content="Stopping due to critical error.")
            return # Stop this agent's execution

        # ... Normal agent processing ...
        yield # ... event ...
```

Setting `ctx.end_invocation = True` is a way to gracefully stop the entire request-response cycle from within the agent or its callbacks/tools (via their respective context objects which also have access to modify the underlying `InvocationContext`'s flag).

## Key Takeaways & Best Practices

*   **Use the Right Context:** Always use the most specific context object provided (`ToolContext` in tools/tool-callbacks, `CallbackContext` in agent/model-callbacks, `ReadonlyContext` where applicable). Use the full `InvocationContext` (`ctx`) directly in `_run_async_impl` / `_run_live_impl` only when necessary.
*   **State for Data Flow:** `context.state` is the primary way to share data, remember preferences, and manage conversational memory *within* an invocation. Use prefixes (`app:`, `user:`, `temp:`) thoughtfully when using persistent storage.
*   **Artifacts for Files:** Use `context.save_artifact` and `context.load_artifact` for managing file references (like paths or URIs) or larger data blobs. Store references, load content on demand.
*   **Tracked Changes:** Modifications to state or artifacts made via context methods are automatically linked to the current step's `EventActions` and handled by the `SessionService`.
*   **Start Simple:** Focus on `state` and basic artifact usage first. Explore authentication, memory, and advanced `InvocationContext` fields (like those for live streaming) as your needs become more complex.

By understanding and effectively using these context objects, you can build more sophisticated, stateful, and capable agents with ADK.

# Deploy to Vertex AI Agent Engine

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="Vertex AI Agent Engine currently supports only Python."}

[Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview)
is a fully managed Google Cloud service enabling developers to deploy, manage,
and scale AI agents in production. Agent Engine handles the infrastructure to
scale agents in production so you can focus on creating intelligent and
impactful applications. This guide provides an accelerated deployment
instruction set for when you want to deploy an ADK project quickly, and a
standard, step-by-step set of instructions for when you want to carefully manage
deploying an agent to Agent Engine.

## Accelerated deployment

This section describes how to perform a deployment using the
[Agent Starter Pack](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack)
(ASP) and the ADK command line interface (CLI) tool. This approach uses the ASP
tool to apply a project template to your existing project, add deployment
artifacts, and prepare your agent project for deployment. These instructions
show you how to use ASP to provision a Google Cloud project with services needed
for deploying your ADK project, as follows:

-   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-ad): Setup Google Cloud
    account, a project, and install required software.
-   [Prepare your ADK project](#prepare-ad): Modify your
    existing ADK project files to get ready for deployment.
-   [Connect to your Google Cloud project](#connect-ad):
    Connect your development environment to Google Cloud and your Google Cloud
    project.
-   [Deploy your ADK project](#deploy-ad):  Provision
    required services in your Google Cloud project and upload your ADK project code.

For information on testing a deployed agent, see [Test deployed agent](#test-deployment).
For more information on using Agent Starter Pack and its command line tools,
see the
[CLI reference](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/cli/enhance.html)
and
[Development guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/development-guide.html).


### Prerequisites {#prerequisites-ad}

You need the following resources configured to use this deployment path:

-   **Google Cloud account**, with administrator access to:
-   **Google Cloud Project**: An empty Google Cloud project with
    [billing enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
    For information on creating projects, see
    [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
-   **Python Environment**: A Python version between 3.9 and 3.13.
-   **UV Tool:** Manage Python development environment and running ASP
    tools. For installation details, see 
    [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
-   **Google Cloud CLI tool**: The gcloud command line interface. For
    installation details, see
    [Google Cloud Command Line Interface](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
-   **Make tool**: Build automation tool. This tool is part of most
    Unix-based systems, for installation details, see the 
    [Make tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) documentation.

### Prepare your ADK project {#prepare-ad}

When you deploy an ADK project to Agent Engine, you need some additional files
to support the deployment operation. The following ASP command backs up your
project and then adds files to your project for deployment purposes.

These instructions assume you have an existing ADK project that you are modifying
for deployment. If you do not have an ADK project, or want to use a test
project, complete the Python
[Quickstart](/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) guide,
which creates a
[multi_tool_agent](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent)
project. The following instructions use the `multi_tool_agent` project as an
example.

To prepare your ADK project for deployment to Agent Engine:

1.  In a terminal window of your development environment, navigate to the
    **parent directory** that contains your agent folder. For example, if your
    project structure is:

    ```
    your-project-directory/
    ├── multi_tool_agent/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── agent.py
    │   └── .env
    ```

    Navigate to `your-project-directory/`

1.  Run the ASP `enhance` command to add the needed files required for
    deployment into your project.

    ```shell
    uvx agent-starter-pack enhance --adk -d agent_engine
    ```

1.  Follow the instructions from the ASP tool. In general, you can accept
    the default answers to all questions. However for the **GCP region**, 
    option, make sure you select one of the 
    [supported regions for Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview#supported-regions).

When you successfully complete this process, the tool shows the following message:

```
> Success! Your agent project is ready.
```

!!! tip "Note"
    The ASP tool may show a reminder to connect to Google Cloud while
    running, but that connection is *not required* at this stage.

For more information about the changes ASP makes to your ADK project, see
[Changes to your ADK project](#adk-asp-changes).

### Connect to your Google Cloud project {#connect-ad}

Before you deploy your ADK project, you must connect to Google Cloud and your
project. After logging into your Google Cloud account, you should verify that
your deployment target project is visible from your account and that it is
configured as your current project.

To connect to Google Cloud and list your project:

1.  In a terminal window of your development environment, login to your
    Google Cloud account:

    ```shell
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

1.  Set your target project using the Google Cloud Project ID:

    ```shell
    gcloud config set project your-project-id-xxxxx
    ```

1.  Verify your Google Cloud target project is set:

    ```shell
    gcloud config get-value project
    ```

Once you have successfully connected to Google Cloud and set your Cloud Project
ID, you are ready to deploy your ADK project files to Agent Engine.

### Deploy your ADK project {#deploy-ad}

When using the ASP tool, you deploy in stages. In the first stage, you run a
`make` command that provisions the services needed to run your ADK workflow on
Agent Engine. In the second stage, your project code is uploaded to the Agent
Engine service and the agent project is executed.

!!! warning "Important"
    *Make sure your Google Cloud target deployment project is set as your ***current
    project*** before performing these steps*. The `make backend` command uses
    your currently set Google Cloud project when it performs a deployment. For
    information on setting and checking your current project, see
    [Connect to your Google Cloud project](#connect-ad).

To deploy your ADK project to Agent Engine in your Google Cloud project:

1.  In a terminal window, ensure you are in the parent directory (e.g.,
    `your-project-directory/`) that contains your agent folder.

1.  Deploy the code from the updated local project into the Google Cloud
development environment, by running the following ASP make command:

    ```shell
    make backend
    ```

Once this process completes successfully, you should be able to interact with
the agent running on Google Cloud Agent Engine. For details on testing the
deployed agent, see the next section.

Once this process completes successfully, you should be able to interact with
the agent running on Google Cloud Agent Engine. For details on testing the
deployed agent, see 
[Test deployed agent](#test-deployment).

### Changes to your ADK project {#adk-asp-changes}

The ASP tools add more files to your project for deployment. The procedure
below backs up your existing project files before modifying them. This guide
uses the
[multi_tool_agent](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent)
project as a reference example. The original project has the following file
structure to start with:

```
multi_tool_agent/
├─ __init__.py
├─ agent.py
└─ .env
```

After running the ASP enhance command to add Agent Engine deployment
information, the new structure is as follows:

```
multi-tool-agent/
├─ app/                 # Core application code
│   ├─ agent.py         # Main agent logic
│   ├─ agent_engine_app.py # Agent Engine application logic
│   └─ utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
├─ .cloudbuild/         # CI/CD pipeline configurations for Google Cloud Build
├─ deployment/          # Infrastructure and deployment scripts
├─ notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for prototyping and evaluation
├─ tests/               # Unit, integration, and load tests
├─ Makefile             # Makefile for common commands
├─ GEMINI.md            # AI-assisted development guide
└─ pyproject.toml       # Project dependencies and configuration
```

See the README.md file in your updated ADK project folder for more information.
For more information on using Agent Starter Pack, see the
[Development guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/development-guide.html).

## Standard deployment

This section describes how to perform a deployment to Agent Engine step-by-step.
These instructions are more appropriate if you want to carefully manage your
deployment settings, or are modifying an existing deployment with Agent Engine.

### Prerequisites

These instructions assume you have already defined an ADK project. If you do not
have an ADK project, see the instructions for creating a test project in
[Define your agent](#define-your-agent).

Before starting deployment procedure, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Google Cloud Project**: A Google Cloud project with the [Vertex AI API enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

2.  **Authenticated gcloud CLI**: You need to be authenticated with Google Cloud. Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```shell
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

3.  **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket**: Agent Engine requires a GCS bucket to stage your agent's code and dependencies for deployment. If you don't have a bucket, create one by following the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).

4.  **Python Environment**: A Python version between 3.9 and 3.13.

5.  **Install Vertex AI SDK**

    Agent Engine is part of the Vertex AI SDK for Python. For more information, you can review the [Agent Engine quickstart documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/quickstart).

    ```shell
    pip install google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]>=1.111
    ```

### Define your agent {#define-your-agent}

These instructions assume you have an existing ADK project that you are modifying
for deployment. If you do not have an ADK project, or want to use a test
project, complete the Python
[Quickstart](/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) guide,
which creates a
[multi_tool_agent](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent)
project. The following instructions use the `multi_tool_agent` project as an
example.

### Initialize Vertex AI

Next, initialize the Vertex AI SDK. This tells the SDK which Google Cloud project and region to use, and where to stage files for deployment.

!!! tip "For IDE Users"
    You can place this initialization code in a separate `deploy.py` script along with the deployment logic for the following steps: 3 through 6.

```python title="deploy.py"
import vertexai
from agent import root_agent # modify this if your agent is not in agent.py

# TODO: Fill in these values for your project
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"  # For other options, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview#supported-regions
STAGING_BUCKET = "gs://your-gcs-bucket-name"

# Initialize the Vertex AI SDK
vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET,
)
```

### Prepare the agent for deployment

To make your agent compatible with Agent Engine, you need to wrap it in an `AdkApp` object.

```python title="deploy.py"
from vertexai import agent_engines

# Wrap the agent in an AdkApp object
app = agent_engines.AdkApp(
    agent=root_agent,
    enable_tracing=True,
)
```

!!!info
    When an AdkApp is deployed to Agent Engine, it automatically uses `VertexAiSessionService` for persistent, managed session state. This provides multi-turn conversational memory without any additional configuration. For local testing, the application defaults to a temporary, in-memory session service.

### Test agent locally (optional)

Before deploying, you can test your agent's behavior locally.

The `async_stream_query` method returns a stream of events that represent the agent's execution trace.

```python title="deploy.py"
# Create a local session to maintain conversation history
session = await app.async_create_session(user_id="u_123")
print(session)
```

Expected output for `create_session` (local):

```console
Session(id='c6a33dae-26ef-410c-9135-b434a528291f', app_name='default-app-name', user_id='u_123', state={}, events=[], last_update_time=1743440392.8689594)
```

Send a query to the agent. Copy-paste the following code to your "deploy.py" python script or a notebook.

```py title="deploy.py"
events = []
async for event in app.async_stream_query(
    user_id="u_123",
    session_id=session.id,
    message="whats the weather in new york",
):
    events.append(event)

# The full event stream shows the agent's thought process
print("--- Full Event Stream ---")
for event in events:
    print(event)

# For quick tests, you can extract just the final text response
final_text_responses = [
    e for e in events
    if e.get("content", {}).get("parts", [{}])[0].get("text")
    and not e.get("content", {}).get("parts", [{}])[0].get("function_call")
]
if final_text_responses:
    print("\n--- Final Response ---")
    print(final_text_responses[0]["content"]["parts"][0]["text"])
```

#### Understanding the output

When you run the code above, you will see a few types of events:

*   **Tool Call Event**: The model asks to call a tool (e.g., `get_weather`).
*   **Tool Response Event**: The system provides the result of the tool call back to the model.
*   **Model Response Event**: The final text response from the agent after it has processed the tool results.

Expected output for `async_stream_query` (local):

```console
{'parts': [{'function_call': {'id': 'af-a33fedb0-29e6-4d0c-9eb3-00c402969395', 'args': {'city': 'new york'}, 'name': 'get_weather'}}], 'role': 'model'}
{'parts': [{'function_response': {'id': 'af-a33fedb0-29e6-4d0c-9eb3-00c402969395', 'name': 'get_weather', 'response': {'status': 'success', 'report': 'The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).'}}}], 'role': 'user'}
{'parts': [{'text': 'The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).'}], 'role': 'model'}
```

### Deploy to agent engine

Once you are satisfied with your agent's local behavior, you can deploy it. You can do this using the Python SDK or the `adk` command-line tool.

This process packages your code, builds it into a container, and deploys it to the managed Agent Engine service. This process can take several minutes.

=== "ADK CLI"

    You can deploy from your terminal using the `adk deploy` command line tool.
    The following example deploy command uses the `multi_tool_agent` sample
    code as the project to be deployed:

    ```shell
    adk deploy agent_engine \
        --project=my-cloud-project-xxxxx \
        --region=us-central1 \
        --staging_bucket=gs://my-cloud-project-staging-bucket-name \
        --display_name="My Agent Name" \
        /multi_tool_agent
    ```

    Find the names of your available storage buckets in the
    [Cloud Storage Bucket](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/storage/browser)
    section of your deployment project in the Google Cloud Console.
    For more details on using the `adk deploy` command, see the 
    [ADK CLI reference](/adk-docs/api-reference/cli/cli.html#adk-deploy).

    !!! tip
        Make sure your main ADK agent definition (`root_agent`) is 
        discoverable when deploying your ADK project.

=== "Python"

    This code block initiates the deployment from a Python script or notebook.

    ```python title="deploy.py"
    from vertexai import agent_engines

    remote_app = agent_engines.create(
        agent_engine=app,
        requirements=[
            "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]"   
        ]
    )

    print(f"Deployment finished!")
    print(f"Resource Name: {remote_app.resource_name}")
    # Resource Name: "projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/{LOCATION}/reasoningEngines/{RESOURCE_ID}"
    #       Note: The PROJECT_NUMBER is different than the PROJECT_ID.
    ```

#### Monitoring and verification

*   You can monitor the deployment status in the [Agent Engine UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines) in the Google Cloud Console.
*   The `remote_app.resource_name` is the unique identifier for your deployed agent. You will need it to interact with the agent. You can also get this from the response returned by the ADK CLI command.
*   For additional details, you can visit the Agent Engine documentation [deploying an agent](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/deploy) and [managing deployed agents](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/manage/overview).

## Test deployed agent {#test-deployment}

Once you have completed the deployment of your agent to Agent Engine, you can
view your deployed agent through the Google Cloud Console, and interact
with the agent using REST calls or the Vertex AI SDK for Python.

To view your deployed agent in the Cloud Console:

-   Navigate to the Agent Engine page in the Google Cloud Console:
    [https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines)

This page lists all deployed agents in your currently selected Google Cloud 
project. If you do not see your agent listed, make sure you have your
target project selected in Google Cloud Console. For more information on
selecting an exising Google Cloud project, see
[Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects).

### Find Google Cloud project information

You need the address and resource identification for your project (`PROJECT_ID`,
`LOCATION`, `RESOURCE_ID`) to be able to test your deployment. You can use Cloud
Console or the `gcloud` command line tool to find this information. 

To find your project information with Google Cloud Console:

1.  In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Agent Engine page:
    [https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines)

1.  At the top of the page, select **API URLs**, and then copy the **Query
    URL** string for your deployed agent, which should be in this format:

        https://$(LOCATION_ID)-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$(PROJECT_ID)/locations/$(LOCATION_ID)/reasoningEngines/$(RESOURCE_ID):query

To find your project information with `gloud`:

1.  In your development environment, make sure you are authenticated to 
    Google Cloud and run the following command to list your project:

    ```shell
    gcloud projects list
    ```

1.  Take the Project ID used for deployment and run this command to get
    the additional details:

    ```shell
    gcloud asset search-all-resources \
        --scope=projects/$(PROJECT_ID) \
        --asset-types='aiplatform.googleapis.com/ReasoningEngine' \
        --format="table(name,assetType,location,reasoning_engine_id)"
    ```

### Test using REST calls

A simple way to interact with your deployed agent in Agent Engine is to use REST
calls with the `curl` tool. This section describes the how to check your
connection to the agent and also to test processing of a request by the deployed
agent.

#### Check connection to agent

You can check your connection to the running agent using the **Query URL**
available in the Agent Engine section of the Cloud Console. This check does not
execute the deployed agent, but returns information about the agent.

To send a REST call get a response from deployed agent:

-   In a terminal window of your development environment, build a request
    and execute it:

    ```shell
    curl -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
        "https://$(LOCATION)-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$(PROJECT_ID)/locations/$(LOCATION)/reasoningEngines"
    ```

If your deployment was successful, this request responds with a list of valid
requests and expected data formats. 

!!! tip "Access for agent connections"
    This connection test requires the calling user has a valid access token for the
    deployed agent. When testing from other environments, make sure the calling user
    has access to connect to the agent in your Google Cloud project.

#### Send an agent request

When getting responses from your agent project, you must first create a
session, receive a Session ID, and then send your requests using that Session
ID. This process is described in the following instructions.

To test interaction with the deployed agent via REST:

1.  In a terminal window of your development environment, create a session
    by building a request using this template:

    ```shell
    curl \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        https://$(LOCATION)-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$(PROJECT_ID)/locations/$(LOCATION)/reasoningEngines/$(RESOURCE_ID):query \
        -d '{"class_method": "async_create_session", "input": {"user_id": "u_123"},}'
    ```

1.  In the response to the previous command, extract the created **Session ID**
    from the **id** field:

    ```json
    {
        "output": {
            "userId": "u_123",
            "lastUpdateTime": 1757690426.337745,
            "state": {},
            "id": "4857885913439920384", # Session ID
            "appName": "9888888855577777776",
            "events": []
        }
    }
    ```

1.  In a terminal window of your development environment, send a message to
    your agent by building a request using this template and the Session ID
    created in the previous step:

    ```shell
    curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://$(LOCATION)-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/$(PROJECT_ID)/locations/$(LOCATION)/reasoningEngines/$(RESOURCE_ID):streamQuery?alt=sse -d '{
    "class_method": "async_stream_query",
    "input": {
        "user_id": "u_123",
        "session_id": "4857885913439920384",
        "message": "Hey whats the weather in new york today?",
    }
    }'
    ```

This request should generate a response from your deployed agent code in JSON
format. For more information about interacting with a deployed ADK agent in
Agent Engine using REST calls, see
[Manage deployed agents](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/manage/overview#console)
and
[Use a Agent Development Kit agent](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/use/adk)
in the Agent Engine documentation.

### Test using Python

You can use Python code for more sophisticated and repeatable testing of your
agent deployed in Agent Engine. These instructions describe how to create
a session with the deployed agent, and then send a request to the agent for
processing.

#### Create a remote session

Use the `remote_app` object to create a connection to deployed, remote agent:

```py
# If you are in a new script or used the ADK CLI to deploy, you can connect like this:
# remote_app = agent_engines.get("your-agent-resource-name")
remote_session = await remote_app.async_create_session(user_id="u_456")
print(remote_session)
```

Expected output for `create_session` (remote):

```console
{'events': [],
'user_id': 'u_456',
'state': {},
'id': '7543472750996750336',
'app_name': '7917477678498709504',
'last_update_time': 1743683353.030133}
```

The `id` value is the session ID, and `app_name` is the resource ID of the
deployed agent on Agent Engine.

#### Send queries to your remote agent

```py
async for event in remote_app.async_stream_query(
    user_id="u_456",
    session_id=remote_session["id"],
    message="whats the weather in new york",
):
    print(event)
```

Expected output for `async_stream_query` (remote):

```console
{'parts': [{'function_call': {'id': 'af-f1906423-a531-4ecf-a1ef-723b05e85321', 'args': {'city': 'new york'}, 'name': 'get_weather'}}], 'role': 'model'}
{'parts': [{'function_response': {'id': 'af-f1906423-a531-4ecf-a1ef-723b05e85321', 'name': 'get_weather', 'response': {'status': 'success', 'report': 'The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).'}}}], 'role': 'user'}
{'parts': [{'text': 'The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).'}], 'role': 'model'}
```

For more information about interacting with a deployed ADK agent in
Agent Engine, see
[Manage deployed agents](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/manage/overview)
and
[Use a Agent Development Kit agent](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/use/adk)
in the Agent Engine documentation.

#### Sending Multimodal Queries

To send multimodal queries (e.g., including images) to your agent, you can construct the `message` parameter of `async_stream_query` with a list of `types.Part` objects. Each part can be text or an image.

To include an image, you can use `types.Part.from_uri`, providing a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) URI for the image.

```python
from google.genai import types

image_part = types.Part.from_uri(
    file_uri="gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/image/scones.jpg",
    mime_type="image/jpeg",
)
text_part = types.Part.from_text(
    text="What is in this image?",
)

async for event in remote_app.async_stream_query(
    user_id="u_456",
    session_id=remote_session["id"],
    message=[text_part, image_part],
):
    print(event)
```

!!!note 
    While the underlying communication with the model may involve Base64
    encoding for images, the recommended and supported method for sending image
    data to an agent deployed on Agent Engine is by providing a GCS URI.

## Deployment payload {#payload}

When you deploy your ADK agent project to Agent Engine,
the following content is uploaded to the service:

- Your ADK agent code
- Any dependencies declared in your ADK agent code

The deployment *does not* include the ADK API server or the ADK web user
interface libraries. The Agent Engine service provides the libraries for ADK API
server functionality.

## Clean up deployments

If you have performed deployments as tests, it is a good practice to clean up
your cloud resources after you have finished. You can delete the deployed Agent
Engine instance to avoid any unexpected charges on your Google Cloud account.

```python
remote_app.delete(force=True)
```

The `force=True` parameter also deletes any child resources that were generated
from the deployed agent, such as sessions. You can also delete your deployed
agent via the
[Agent Engine UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines)
on Google Cloud.

================
File: docs/deploy/cloud-run.md
================
# Deploy to Cloud Run

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
is a fully managed platform that enables you to run your code directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure.

To deploy your agent, you can use either the `adk deploy cloud_run` command _(recommended for Python)_, or with `gcloud run deploy` command through Cloud Run.

## Agent sample

For each of the commands, we will reference a the `Capital Agent` sample defined on the [LLM agent](../agents/llm-agents.md) page. We will assume it's in a directory (eg: `capital_agent`).

To proceed, confirm that your agent code is configured as follows:

=== "Python"

    1. Agent code is in a file called `agent.py` within your agent directory.
    2. Your agent variable is named `root_agent`.
    3. `__init__.py` is within your agent directory and contains `from . import agent`.
    4. Your `requirements.txt` file is present in the agent directory.

=== "Java"

    1. Agent code is in a file called `CapitalAgent.java` within your agent directory.
    2. Your agent variable is global and follows the format `public static final BaseAgent ROOT_AGENT`.
    3. Your agent definition is present in a static class method.

    Refer to the following section for more details. You can also find a [sample app](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/java/cloud-run) in the Github repo.

## Environment variables

Set your environment variables as described in the [Setup and Installation](../get-started/installation.md) guide.

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1 # Or your preferred location
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True
```

_(Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID)_

Alternatively you can also use an API key from AI Studio

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1 # Or your preferred location
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
*(Replace `your-project-id` with your actual GCP project ID and `your-api-key` with your actual API key from AI Studio)*

## Deployment payload {#payload}

When you deploy your ADK agent workflow to the Google Cloud Run,
the following content is uploaded to the service:

- Your ADK agent code
- Any dependencies declared in your ADK agent code
- ADK API server code version used by your agent

The default deployment *does not* include the ADK web user interface libraries,
unless you specify it as deployment setting, such as the `--with_ui` option for
`adk deploy cloud_run` command.

## Deployment commands

=== "Python - adk CLI"

    ###  adk CLI

    The `adk deploy cloud_run` command deploys your agent code to Google Cloud Run.

    Ensure you have authenticated with Google Cloud (`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project <your-project-id>`).

    #### Setup environment variables

    Optional but recommended: Setting environment variables can make the deployment commands cleaner.

    ```bash
    # Set your Google Cloud Project ID
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"

    # Set your desired Google Cloud Location
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1" # Example location

    # Set the path to your agent code directory
    export AGENT_PATH="./capital_agent" # Assuming capital_agent is in the current directory

    # Set a name for your Cloud Run service (optional)
    export SERVICE_NAME="capital-agent-service"

    # Set an application name (optional)
    export APP_NAME="capital-agent-app"
    ```

    #### Command usage

    ##### Minimal command

    ```bash
    adk deploy cloud_run \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    --region=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    $AGENT_PATH
    ```

    ##### Full command with optional flags

    ```bash
    adk deploy cloud_run \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    --region=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --service_name=$SERVICE_NAME \
    --app_name=$APP_NAME \
    --with_ui \
    $AGENT_PATH
    ```

    ##### Arguments

    * `AGENT_PATH`: (Required) Positional argument specifying the path to the directory containing your agent's source code (e.g., `$AGENT_PATH` in the examples, or `capital_agent/`). This directory must contain at least an `__init__.py` and your main agent file (e.g., `agent.py`).

    ##### Options

    * `--project TEXT`: (Required) Your Google Cloud project ID (e.g., `$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`).
    * `--region TEXT`: (Required) The Google Cloud location for deployment (e.g., `$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, `us-central1`).
    * `--service_name TEXT`: (Optional) The name for the Cloud Run service (e.g., `$SERVICE_NAME`). Defaults to `adk-default-service-name`.
    * `--app_name TEXT`: (Optional) The application name for the ADK API server (e.g., `$APP_NAME`). Defaults to the name of the directory specified by `AGENT_PATH` (e.g., `capital_agent` if `AGENT_PATH` is `./capital_agent`).
    * `--agent_engine_id TEXT`: (Optional) If you are using a managed session service via Vertex AI Agent Engine, provide its resource ID here.
    * `--port INTEGER`: (Optional) The port number the ADK API server will listen on within the container. Defaults to 8000.
    * `--with_ui`: (Optional) If included, deploys the ADK dev UI alongside the agent API server. By default, only the API server is deployed.
    * `--temp_folder TEXT`: (Optional) Specifies a directory for storing intermediate files generated during the deployment process. Defaults to a timestamped folder in the system's temporary directory. *(Note: This option is generally not needed unless troubleshooting issues).*
    * `--help`: Show the help message and exit.

    ##### Authenticated access
    During the deployment process, you might be prompted: `Allow unauthenticated invocations to [your-service-name] (y/N)?`.

    * Enter `y` to allow public access to your agent's API endpoint without authentication.
    * Enter `N` (or press Enter for the default) to require authentication (e.g., using an identity token as shown in the "Testing your agent" section).

    Upon successful execution, the command will deploy your agent to Cloud Run and provide the URL of the deployed service.

=== "Python - gcloud CLI"

    ### gcloud CLI for Python

    Alternatively, you can deploy using the standard `gcloud run deploy` command with a `Dockerfile`. This method requires more manual setup compared to the `adk` command but offers flexibility, particularly if you want to embed your agent within a custom [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application.

    Ensure you have authenticated with Google Cloud (`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project <your-project-id>`).

    #### Project Structure

    Organize your project files as follows:

    ```txt
    your-project-directory/
    ├── capital_agent/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── agent.py       # Your agent code (see "Agent sample" tab)
    ├── main.py            # FastAPI application entry point
    ├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
    └── Dockerfile         # Container build instructions
    ```

    Create the following files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`) in the root of `your-project-directory/`.

    #### Code files

    1. This file sets up the FastAPI application using `get_fast_api_app()` from ADK:

        ```python title="main.py"
        import os

        import uvicorn
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        from google.adk.cli.fast_api import get_fast_api_app

        # Get the directory where main.py is located
        AGENT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        # Example session service URI (e.g., SQLite)
        SESSION_SERVICE_URI = "sqlite:///./sessions.db"
        # Example allowed origins for CORS
        ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["http://localhost", "http://localhost:8080", "*"]
        # Set web=True if you intend to serve a web interface, False otherwise
        SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE = True

        # Call the function to get the FastAPI app instance
        # Ensure the agent directory name ('capital_agent') matches your agent folder
        app: FastAPI = get_fast_api_app(
            agents_dir=AGENT_DIR,
            session_service_uri=SESSION_SERVICE_URI,
            allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
            web=SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE,
        )

        # You can add more FastAPI routes or configurations below if needed
        # Example:
        # @app.get("/hello")
        # async def read_root():
        #     return {"Hello": "World"}

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Use the PORT environment variable provided by Cloud Run, defaulting to 8080
            uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)))
        ```

        *Note: We specify `agent_dir` to the directory `main.py` is in and use `os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)` for Cloud Run compatibility.*

    2. List the necessary Python packages:

        ```txt title="requirements.txt"
        google-adk
        # Add any other dependencies your agent needs
        ```

    3. Define the container image:

        ```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
        FROM python:3.13-slim
        WORKDIR /app

        COPY requirements.txt .
        RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

        RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" myuser && \
            chown -R myuser:myuser /app

        COPY . .

        USER myuser

        ENV PATH="/home/myuser/.local/bin:$PATH"

        CMD ["sh", "-c", "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"]
        ```

    #### Defining Multiple Agents

    You can define and deploy multiple agents within the same Cloud Run instance by creating separate folders in the root of `your-project-directory/`. Each folder represents one agent and must define a `root_agent` in its configuration.

    Example structure:

    ```txt
    your-project-directory/
    ├── capital_agent/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── agent.py       # contains `root_agent` definition
    ├── population_agent/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── agent.py       # contains `root_agent` definition
    └── ...
    ```

    #### Deploy using `gcloud`

    Navigate to `your-project-directory` in your terminal.

    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy capital-agent-service \
    --source . \
    --region $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT,GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION,GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=$GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI"
    # Add any other necessary environment variables your agent might need
    ```

    * `capital-agent-service`: The name you want to give your Cloud Run service.
    * `--source .`: Tells gcloud to build the container image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
    * `--region`: Specifies the deployment region.
    * `--project`: Specifies the GCP project.
    * `--allow-unauthenticated`: Allows public access to the service. Remove this flag for private services.
    * `--set-env-vars`: Passes necessary environment variables to the running container. Ensure you include all variables required by ADK and your agent (like API keys if not using Application Default Credentials).

    `gcloud` will build the Docker image, push it to Google Artifact Registry, and deploy it to Cloud Run. Upon completion, it will output the URL of your deployed service.

    For a full list of deployment options, see the [`gcloud run deploy` reference documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy).

=== "Java - gcloud CLI"

    ### gcloud CLI for Java

    You can deploy Java Agents using the standard `gcloud run deploy` command and a `Dockerfile`. This is the current recommended way to deploy Java Agents to Google Cloud Run.

    Ensure you are [authenticated](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) with Google Cloud.
    Specifically, run the commands `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project <your-project-id>` from your terminal.

    #### Project Structure

    Organize your project files as follows:

    ```txt
    your-project-directory/
    ├── src/
    │   └── main/
    │       └── java/
    │             └── agents/
    │                 ├── capitalagent/
    │                     └── CapitalAgent.java    # Your agent code
    ├── pom.xml                                    # Java adk and adk-dev dependencies
    └── Dockerfile                                 # Container build instructions
    ```

    Create the `pom.xml` and `Dockerfile` in the root of your project directory. Your Agent code file (`CapitalAgent.java`) inside a directory as shown above.

    #### Code files

    1. This is our Agent definition. This is the same code as present in [LLM agent](../agents/llm-agents.md) with two caveats:

           * The Agent is now initialized as a **global public static final variable**.

           * The definition of the agent can be exposed in a static method or inlined during declaration.

        See the code for the `CapitalAgent` example in the 
        [examples](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/blob/main/examples/java/cloud-run/src/main/java/agents/capitalagent/CapitalAgent.java) 
        repository.

    2. Add the following dependencies and plugin to the pom.xml file.

        ```xml title="pom.xml"
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
             <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
             <artifactId>google-adk</artifactId>
             <version>0.1.0</version>
          </dependency>
          <dependency>
             <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
             <artifactId>google-adk-dev</artifactId>
             <version>0.1.0</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>

        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
          <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.2.0</version>
          <configuration>
            <mainClass>com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer</mainClass>
            <classpathScope>compile</classpathScope>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
        ```

    3.  Define the container image:

        ```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
        --8<-- "examples/java/cloud-run/Dockerfile"
        ```

    #### Deploy using `gcloud`

    Navigate to `your-project-directory` in your terminal.

    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy capital-agent-service \
    --source . \
    --region $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT,GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION,GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=$GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI"
    # Add any other necessary environment variables your agent might need
    ```

    * `capital-agent-service`: The name you want to give your Cloud Run service.
    * `--source .`: Tells gcloud to build the container image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
    * `--region`: Specifies the deployment region.
    * `--project`: Specifies the GCP project.
    * `--allow-unauthenticated`: Allows public access to the service. Remove this flag for private services.
    * `--set-env-vars`: Passes necessary environment variables to the running container. Ensure you include all variables required by ADK and your agent (like API keys if not using Application Default Credentials).

    `gcloud` will build the Docker image, push it to Google Artifact Registry, and deploy it to Cloud Run. Upon completion, it will output the URL of your deployed service.

    For a full list of deployment options, see the [`gcloud run deploy` reference documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy).

## Testing your agent

Once your agent is deployed to Cloud Run, you can interact with it via the deployed UI (if enabled) or directly with its API endpoints using tools like `curl`. You'll need the service URL provided after deployment.

=== "UI Testing"

    ### UI Testing

    If you deployed your agent with the UI enabled:

    *   **adk CLI:** You included the `--with_ui` flag during deployment.
    *   **gcloud CLI:** You set `SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE = True` in your `main.py`.

    You can test your agent by simply navigating to the Cloud Run service URL provided after deployment in your web browser.

    ```bash
    # Example URL format
    # https://your-service-name-abc123xyz.a.run.app
    ```

    The ADK dev UI allows you to interact with your agent, manage sessions, and view execution details directly in the browser.

    To verify your agent is working as intended, you can:

    1. Select your agent from the dropdown menu.
    2. Type a message and verify that you receive an expected response from your agent.

    If you experience any unexpected behavior, check the [Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) console logs.

=== "API Testing (curl)"

    ### API Testing (curl)

    You can interact with the agent's API endpoints using tools like `curl`. This is useful for programmatic interaction or if you deployed without the UI.

    You'll need the service URL provided after deployment and potentially an identity token for authentication if your service isn't set to allow unauthenticated access.

    #### Set the application URL

    Replace the example URL with the actual URL of your deployed Cloud Run service.

    ```bash
    export APP_URL="YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE_URL"
    # Example: export APP_URL="https://adk-default-service-name-abc123xyz.a.run.app"
    ```

    #### Get an identity token (if needed)

    If your service requires authentication (i.e., you didn't use `--allow-unauthenticated` with `gcloud` or answered 'N' to the prompt with `adk`), obtain an identity token.

    ```bash
    export TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)
    ```

    *If your service allows unauthenticated access, you can omit the `-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"` header from the `curl` commands below.*

    #### List available apps

    Verify the deployed application name.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $APP_URL/list-apps
    ```

    *(Adjust the `app_name` in the following commands based on this output if needed. The default is often the agent directory name, e.g., `capital_agent`)*.

    #### Create or Update a Session

    Initialize or update the state for a specific user and session. Replace `capital_agent` with your actual app name if different. The values `user_123` and `session_abc` are example identifiers; you can replace them with your desired user and session IDs.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        $APP_URL/apps/capital_agent/users/user_123/sessions/session_abc \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"state": {"preferred_language": "English", "visit_count": 5}}'
    ```

    #### Run the Agent

    Send a prompt to your agent. Replace `capital_agent` with your app name and adjust the user/session IDs and prompt as needed.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
        $APP_URL/run_sse \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
        "app_name": "capital_agent",
        "user_id": "user_123",
        "session_id": "session_abc",
        "new_message": {
            "role": "user",
            "parts": [{
            "text": "What is the capital of Canada?"
            }]
        },
        "streaming": false
        }'
    ```

    * Set `"streaming": true` if you want to receive Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    * The response will contain the agent's execution events, including the final answer.

# Deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/gke) is the Google Cloud managed Kubernetes service. It allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes.

To deploy your agent you will need to have a Kubernetes cluster running on GKE. You can create a cluster using the Google Cloud Console or the `gcloud` command line tool.

In this example we will deploy a simple agent to GKE. The agent will be a FastAPI application that uses `Gemini 2.0 Flash` as the LLM. We can use Vertex AI or AI Studio as the LLM provider using the Environment variable `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`.

## Environment variables

Set your environment variables as described in the [Setup and Installation](../get-started/installation.md) guide. You also need to install the `kubectl` command line tool. You can find instructions to do so in the [Google Kubernetes Engine Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl).

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id # Your GCP project ID
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1 # Or your preferred location
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true # Set to true if using Vertex AI
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe --format json $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT | jq -r ".projectNumber")
```

If you don't have `jq` installed, you can use the following command to get the project number:

```bash
gcloud projects describe $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

And copy the project number from the output.

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER=YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER
```



## Enable APIs and Permissions

Ensure you have authenticated with Google Cloud (`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project <your-project-id>`).

Enable the necessary APIs for your project. You can do this using the `gcloud` command line tool.

```bash
gcloud services enable \
    container.googleapis.com \
    artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

Grant necessary roles to the default compute engine service account required by the `gcloud builds submit` command.



```bash
ROLES_TO_ASSIGN=(
    "roles/artifactregistry.writer"
    "roles/storage.objectViewer"
    "roles/logging.viewer"
    "roles/logging.logWriter"
)

for ROLE in "${ROLES_TO_ASSIGN[@]}"; do
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
        --member="serviceAccount:${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role="${ROLE}"
done
```

## Deployment payload {#payload}

When you deploy your ADK agent workflow to the Google Cloud GKE,
the following content is uploaded to the service:

- Your ADK agent code
- Any dependencies declared in your ADK agent code
- ADK API server code version used by your agent

The default deployment *does not* include the ADK web user interface libraries,
unless you specify it as deployment setting, such as the `--with_ui` option for
`adk deploy gke` command.

## Deployment options

You can deploy your agent to GKE either **manually using Kubernetes manifests** or **automatically using the `adk deploy gke` command**. Choose the approach that best suits your workflow.


## Option 1: Manual Deployment using gcloud and kubectl

### Create a GKE cluster

You can create a GKE cluster using the `gcloud` command line tool. This example creates an Autopilot cluster named `adk-cluster` in the `us-central1` region.

> If creating a GKE Standard cluster, make sure [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) is enabled. Workload Identity is enabled by default in an AutoPilot cluster.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create-auto adk-cluster \
    --location=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

After creating the cluster, you need to connect to it using `kubectl`. This command configures `kubectl` to use the credentials for your new cluster.

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials adk-cluster \
    --location=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

### Create Your Agent

We will reference the `capital_agent` example defined on the [LLM agents](../agents/llm-agents.md) page.

To proceed, organize your project files as follows:

```txt
your-project-directory/
├── capital_agent/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent.py       # Your agent code (see "Capital Agent example" below)
├── main.py            # FastAPI application entry point
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
└── Dockerfile         # Container build instructions
```



### Code files

Create the following files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `capital_agent/agent.py`, `capital_agent/__init__.py`) in the root of `your-project-directory/`.

1. This is the Capital Agent example inside the `capital_agent` directory

    ```python title="capital_agent/agent.py"
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent 

    # Define a tool function
    def get_capital_city(country: str) -> str:
      """Retrieves the capital city for a given country."""
      # Replace with actual logic (e.g., API call, database lookup)
      capitals = {"france": "Paris", "japan": "Tokyo", "canada": "Ottawa"}
      return capitals.get(country.lower(), f"Sorry, I don't know the capital of {country}.")

    # Add the tool to the agent
    capital_agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="capital_agent", #name of your agent
        description="Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.",
        instruction="""You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country... (previous instruction text)""",
        tools=[get_capital_city] # Provide the function directly
    )

    # ADK will discover the root_agent instance
    root_agent = capital_agent
    ```
    
    Mark your directory as a python package

    ```python title="capital_agent/__init__.py"

    from . import agent
    ```

2. This file sets up the FastAPI application using `get_fast_api_app()` from ADK:

    ```python title="main.py"
    import os

    import uvicorn
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from google.adk.cli.fast_api import get_fast_api_app

    # Get the directory where main.py is located
    AGENT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    # Example session service URI (e.g., SQLite)
    SESSION_SERVICE_URI = "sqlite:///./sessions.db"
    # Example allowed origins for CORS
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["http://localhost", "http://localhost:8080", "*"]
    # Set web=True if you intend to serve a web interface, False otherwise
    SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE = True

    # Call the function to get the FastAPI app instance
    # Ensure the agent directory name ('capital_agent') matches your agent folder
    app: FastAPI = get_fast_api_app(
        agents_dir=AGENT_DIR,
        session_service_uri=SESSION_SERVICE_URI,
        allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
        web=SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE,
    )

    # You can add more FastAPI routes or configurations below if needed
    # Example:
    # @app.get("/hello")
    # async def read_root():
    #     return {"Hello": "World"}

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Use the PORT environment variable provided by Cloud Run, defaulting to 8080
        uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)))
    ```

    *Note: We specify `agent_dir` to the directory `main.py` is in and use `os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)` for Cloud Run compatibility.*

3. List the necessary Python packages:

    ```txt title="requirements.txt"
    google-adk
    # Add any other dependencies your agent needs
    ```

4. Define the container image:

    ```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
    FROM python:3.13-slim
    WORKDIR /app

    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" myuser && \
        chown -R myuser:myuser /app

    COPY . .

    USER myuser

    ENV PATH="/home/myuser/.local/bin:$PATH"

    CMD ["sh", "-c", "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"]
    ```

### Build the container image

You need to create a Google Artifact Registry repository to store your container images. You can do this using the `gcloud` command line tool.

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create adk-repo \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --description="ADK repository"
```

Build the container image using the `gcloud` command line tool. This example builds the image and tags it as `adk-repo/adk-agent:latest`.

```bash
gcloud builds submit \
    --tag $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/adk-repo/adk-agent:latest \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    .
```

Verify the image is built and pushed to the Artifact Registry:

```bash
gcloud artifacts docker images list \
  $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/adk-repo \
  --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

### Configure Kubernetes Service Account for Vertex AI

If your agent uses Vertex AI, you need to create a Kubernetes service account with the necessary permissions. This example creates a service account named `adk-agent-sa` and binds it to the `Vertex AI User` role.

> If you are using AI Studio and accessing the model with an API key you can skip this step.

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount adk-agent-sa
```

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding projects/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --role=roles/aiplatform.user \
    --member=principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}.svc.id.goog/subject/ns/default/sa/adk-agent-sa \
    --condition=None
```

### Create the Kubernetes manifest files

Create a Kubernetes deployment manifest file named `deployment.yaml` in your project directory. This file defines how to deploy your application on GKE.

```yaml title="deployment.yaml"
cat <<  EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: adk-agent
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:

    spec:
      serviceAccount: adk-agent-sa
      containers:
      - name: adk-agent
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        image: $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/adk-repo/adk-agent:latest
        resources:
          limits:

            ephemeral-storage: "128Mi"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
          - name: PORT
            value: "8080"
          - name: GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
            value: $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
          - name: GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
            value: $GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION
          - name: GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI
            value: "$GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI"

### Deploy the Application

Deploy the application using the `kubectl` command line tool. This command applies the deployment and service manifest files to your GKE cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

After a few moments, you can check the status of your deployment using:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l=app=adk-agent
```

This command lists the pods associated with your deployment. You should see a pod with a status of `Running`.

Once the pod is running, you can check the status of the service using:

```bash
kubectl get service adk-agent
```

If the output shows a `External IP`, it means your service is accessible from the internet. It may take a few minutes for the external IP to be assigned.

You can get the external IP address of your service using:

```bash
kubectl get svc adk-agent -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

## Option 2: Automated Deployment using `adk deploy gke`

ADK provides a CLI command to streamline GKE deployment. This avoids the need to manually build images, write Kubernetes manifests, or push to Artifact Registry.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **A running GKE cluster:** You need an active Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud.

2. **Required CLIs:** 
    * **`gcloud` CLI:** The Google Cloud CLI must be installed, authenticated, and configured to use your target project. Run `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`.
    * **kubectl:** The Kubernetes CLI must be installed to deploy the application to your cluster.

3. **Enabled Google Cloud APIs:** Make sure the following APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project:
    * Kubernetes Engine API (`container.googleapis.com`)
    * Cloud Build API (`cloudbuild.googleapis.com`)
    * Container Registry API (`containerregistry.googleapis.com`)

4. **Required IAM Permissions:** The user or Compute Engine default service account running the command needs, at a minimum, the following roles:

   * **Kubernetes Engine Developer** (`roles/container.developer`): To interact with the GKE cluster.

   * **Storage Object Viewer** (`roles/storage.objectViewer`): To allow Cloud Build to download the source code from the Cloud Storage bucket where gcloud builds submit uploads it.

   * **Artifact Registry Create on Push Writer** (`roles/artifactregistry.createOnPushWriter`): To allow Cloud Build to push the built container image to Artifact Registry. This role also permits the on-the-fly creation of the special gcr.io repository within Artifact Registry if needed on the first push.

   * **Logs Writer**  (`roles/logging.logWriter`): To allow Cloud Build to write build logs to Cloud Logging.

### The `deploy gke` Command

The command takes the path to your agent and parameters specifying the target GKE cluster.

#### Syntax

```bash
adk deploy gke [OPTIONS] AGENT_PATH
```

### Arguments & Options

| Argument    | Description | Required |
| -------- | ------- | ------  |
| AGENT_PATH  | The local file path to your agent's root directory.    |Yes |
| --project | The Google Cloud Project ID where your GKE cluster is located.     | Yes | 
| --cluster_name   | The name of your GKE cluster.    | Yes |
| --region    | The Google Cloud region of your cluster (e.g., us-central1).    | Yes |
| --with_ui   | Deploys both the agent's back-end API and a companion front-end user interface.    | No |
| --log_level   | Sets the logging level for the deployment process. Options: debug, info, warning, error.     | No |


### How It Works
When you run the `adk deploy gke` command, the ADK performs the following steps automatically:

- Containerization: It builds a Docker container image from your agent's source code.

- Image Push: It tags the container image and pushes it to your project's Artifact Registry.

- Manifest Generation: It dynamically generates the necessary Kubernetes manifest files (a `Deployment` and a `Service`).

- Cluster Deployment: It applies these manifests to your specified GKE cluster, which triggers the following:

The `Deployment` instructs GKE to pull the container image from Artifact Registry and run it in one or more Pods.

The `Service` creates a stable network endpoint for your agent. By default, this is a LoadBalancer service, which provisions a public IP address to expose your agent to the internet.


### Example Usage
Here is a practical example of deploying an agent located at `~/agents/multi_tool_agent/` to a GKE cluster named test.

```bash
adk deploy gke \
    --project myproject \
    --cluster_name test \
    --region us-central1 \
    --with_ui \
    --log_level info \
    ~/agents/multi_tool_agent/
```

### Verifying Your Deployment
If you used `adk deploy gke`, verify the deployment using `kubectl`:

1. Check the Pods: Ensure your agent's pods are in the Running state.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
You should see output like `adk-default-service-name-xxxx-xxxx ... 1/1 Running` in the default namespace.

2. Find the External IP: Get the public IP address for your agent's service.

```bash
kubectl get service
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
adk-default-service-name   LoadBalancer   34.118.228.70   34.63.153.253   80:32581/TCP   5d20h
```

We can navigate to the external IP and interact with the agent via UI
![alt text](../assets/agent-gke-deployment.png)

## Testing your agent

Once your agent is deployed to GKE, you can interact with it via the deployed UI (if enabled) or directly with its API endpoints using tools like `curl`. You'll need the service URL provided after deployment.

=== "UI Testing"

    ### UI Testing

    If you deployed your agent with the UI enabled:

    You can test your agent by simply navigating to the kubernetes service URL in your web browser.

    The ADK dev UI allows you to interact with your agent, manage sessions, and view execution details directly in the browser.

    To verify your agent is working as intended, you can:

    1. Select your agent from the dropdown menu.
    2. Type a message and verify that you receive an expected response from your agent.

    If you experience any unexpected behavior, check the pod logs for your agent using:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -l app=adk-agent
    ```

=== "API Testing (curl)"

    ### API Testing (curl)

    You can interact with the agent's API endpoints using tools like `curl`. This is useful for programmatic interaction or if you deployed without the UI.

    #### Set the application URL

    Replace the example URL with the actual URL of your deployed Cloud Run service.

    ```bash
    export APP_URL=$(kubectl get service adk-agent -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    ```

    #### List available apps

    Verify the deployed application name.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET $APP_URL/list-apps
    ```

    *(Adjust the `app_name` in the following commands based on this output if needed. The default is often the agent directory name, e.g., `capital_agent`)*.

    #### Create or Update a Session

    Initialize or update the state for a specific user and session. Replace `capital_agent` with your actual app name if different. The values `user_123` and `session_abc` are example identifiers; you can replace them with your desired user and session IDs.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
        $APP_URL/apps/capital_agent/users/user_123/sessions/session_abc \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"state": {"preferred_language": "English", "visit_count": 5}}'
    ```

    #### Run the Agent

    Send a prompt to your agent. Replace `capital_agent` with your app name and adjust the user/session IDs and prompt as needed.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST $APP_URL/run_sse \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
        "app_name": "capital_agent",
        "user_id": "user_123",
        "session_id": "session_abc",
        "new_message": {
            "role": "user",
            "parts": [{
            "text": "What is the capital of Canada?"
            }]
        },
        "streaming": false
        }'
    ```

    * Set `"streaming": true` if you want to receive Server-Sent Events (SSE).
    * The response will contain the agent's execution events, including the final answer.

## Troubleshooting

These are some common issues you might encounter when deploying your agent to GKE:

### 403 Permission Denied for `Gemini 2.0 Flash`

This usually means that the Kubernetes service account does not have the necessary permission to access the Vertex AI API. Ensure that you have created the service account and bound it to the `Vertex AI User` role as described in the [Configure Kubernetes Service Account for Vertex AI](#configure-kubernetes-service-account-for-vertex-ai) section. If you are using AI Studio, ensure that you have set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable in the deployment manifest and it is valid.

### 404 or Not Found response

This usually means there is an error in your request. Check the application logs to diagnose the problem. 

```bash

export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app=adk-agent -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl logs $POD_NAME
```

### Attempt to write a readonly database

You might see there is no session id created in the UI and the agent does not respond to any messages. This is usually caused by the SQLite database being read-only. This can happen if you run the agent locally and then create the container image which copies the SQLite database into the container. The database is then read-only in the container.

```bash
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) attempt to write a readonly database
[SQL: UPDATE app_states SET state=?, update_time=CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE app_states.app_name = ?]
```

To fix this issue, you can either:

Delete the SQLite database file from your local machine before building the container image. This will create a new SQLite database when the container is started.

```bash
rm -f sessions.db
```

or (recommended) you can add a `.dockerignore` file to your project directory to exclude the SQLite database from being copied into the container image.

```txt title=".dockerignore"
sessions.db
```

Build the container image abd deploy the application again.

### Insufficent Permission to Stream Logs `ERROR: (gcloud.builds.submit)`

This error can occur when you don't have sufficient permissions to stream build logs, or your VPC-SC security policy restricts access to the default logs bucket.

To check the progress of the build, follow the link provided in the error message or navigate to the Cloud Build page in the Google Cloud Console.

You can also verify the image was built and pushed to the Artifact Registry using the command under the [Build the container image](#build-the-container-image) section.

### Gemini-2.0-Flash Not Supported in Live Api

When using the ADK Dev UI for your deployed agent, text-based chat works, but voice (e.g., clicking the microphone button) fail. You might see a `websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError` in the pod logs indicating that your model is "not supported in the live api".

This error occurs because the agent is configured with a model (like `gemini-2.0-flash` in the example) that does not support the Gemini Live API. The Live API is required for real-time, bidirectional streaming of audio and video.

## Cleanup

To delete the GKE cluster and all associated resources, run:

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete adk-cluster \
    --location=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

To delete the Artifact Registry repository, run:

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories delete adk-repo \
    --location=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

You can also delete the project if you no longer need it. This will delete all resources associated with the project, including the GKE cluster, Artifact Registry repository, and any other resources you created.

```bash
gcloud projects delete $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
```

# Deploying Your Agent

Once you've built and tested your agent using ADK,
the next step is to deploy it so it can be accessed, queried, and used in
production or integrated with other applications. Deployment moves your agent
from your local development machine to a scalable and reliable environment.

<img src="../assets/deploy-agent.png" alt="Deploying your agent">

## Deployment Options

Your ADK agent can be deployed to a range of different environments based
on your needs for production readiness or custom flexibility:

### Agent Engine in Vertex AI

[Agent Engine](agent-engine.md) is a fully managed auto-scaling service on Google Cloud
specifically designed for deploying, managing, and scaling AI agents built with
frameworks such as ADK.

Learn more about [deploying your agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine](agent-engine.md).

### Cloud Run

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a managed auto-scaling compute platform on
Google Cloud that enables you to run your agent as a container-based
application.

Learn more about [deploying your agent to Cloud Run](cloud-run.md).

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) is a managed
Kubernetes service of Google Cloud that allows you to run your agent in a containerized
environment. GKE is a good option if you need more control over the deployment as well as
for running Open Models.

Learn more about [deploying your agent to GKE](gke.md).

### Other Container-friendly Infrastructure

You can manually package your Agent into a container image and then run it in
any environment that supports container images.  For example you can run it
locally in Docker or Podman. This is a good option if you prefer to run offline
or disconnected, or otherwise in a system that has no connection to Google
Cloud.

Follow the instructions for [deploying your agent to Cloud Run](cloud-run.md),
specifically the case where you it describes how to use a custom Dockerfile.

# Evaluation Criteria

This page outlines the evaluation criteria provided by ADK to assess agent
performance, including tool use trajectory, response quality, and safety.

Criterion                                | Description                                               | Reference-Based | Requires Rubrics | LLM-as-a-Judge
:--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------
`tool_trajectory_avg_score`              | Exact match of tool call trajectory                       | Yes             | No               | No
`response_match_score`                   | ROUGE-1 similarity to reference response                  | Yes             | No               | No
`final_response_match_v2`                | LLM-judged semantic match to reference response           | Yes             | No               | Yes
`rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1` | LLM-judged final response quality based on custom rubrics | No              | Yes              | Yes
`rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1`       | LLM-judged tool usage quality based on custom rubrics     | No              | Yes              | Yes
`hallucinations_v1`                      | LLM-judged groundedness of agent response against context | No              | No               | Yes
`safety_v1`                              | Safety/harmlessness of agent response                     | No              | No               | Yes

## tool_trajectory_avg_score

This criterion compares the sequence of tools called by the agent against a list
of expected calls and computes an average score based on exact match.

### When To Use This Criterion?

This criterion is ideal for scenarios where the correctness of an agent's
behavior is strictly dependent on following a precise sequence of tool calls
with exact arguments. Use it when you need to enforce a specific tool execution
path and consider any deviation—whether in tool name, arguments, or order—as a
failure. It is particularly valuable for:

*   **Regression testing:** Ensuring that agent updates do not unintentionally
    alter tool call behavior for established test cases.
*   **Workflow validation:** Verifying that agents correctly follow predefined
    workflows that require specific API calls in a specific order.
*   **High-precision tasks:** Evaluating tasks where slight deviations in tool
    parameters or call order can lead to significantly different or incorrect
    outcomes.

### Details

For each invocation that is being evaluated, this criterion compares the list
and order of tool calls produced by the agent against the list of expected tool
calls. The comparison is done by performing an exact match on the tool name and
tool arguments for each tool call in the list. If all tool calls in an
invocation match exactly in content and order, a score of 1.0 is awarded for
that invocation, otherwise the score is 0.0. The final value is the average of
these scores across all invocations in the eval case.

### How To Use This Criterion?

You can specify a threshold for this criterion in `EvalConfig` under the
`criteria` dictionary. The value should be a float between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the minimum acceptable score for the eval case to pass. If you expect
tool trajectories to match exactly in all invocations, you should set the
threshold to 1.0.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "tool_trajectory_avg_score": 1.0
  }
}
```

### Output And How To Interpret

The output is a score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a perfect match
between actual and expected tool trajectories for all invocations, and 0.0
indicates a complete mismatch for all invocations. Higher scores are better. A
score below 1.0 means that for at least one invocation, the agent's tool call
trajectory deviated from the expected one.

## response_match_score

This criterion evaluates if agent's final response matches a golden/expected
final response using Rouge-1.

### When To Use This Criterion?

Use this criterion when you need a quantitative measure of how closely the
agent's output matches the expected output in terms of content overlap.

### Details

ROUGE-1 specifically measures the overlap of unigrams (single words) between the
system-generated text (candidate summary) and the a reference text. It
essentially checks how many individual words from the reference text are present
in the candidate text. To learn more, see details on
[ROUGE-1](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rouge).

### How To Use This Criterion?

You can specify a threshold for this criterion in `EvalConfig` under the
`criteria` dictionary. The value should be a float between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the minimum acceptable score for the eval case to pass.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "response_match_score": 0.8
  }
}
```

### Output And How To Interpret

Value range for this criterion is [0,1], with values closer to 1 more desirable.

## final_response_match_v2

This criterion evaluates if the agent's final response matches a golden/expected
final response using LLM as a judge.

### When To Use This Criterion?

Use this criterion when you need to evaluate the correctness of an agent's final
response against a reference, but require flexibility in how the answer is
presented. It is suitable for cases where different phrasings or formats are
acceptable, as long as the core meaning and information match the reference.
This criterion is a good choice for evaluating question-answering,
summarization, or other generative tasks where semantic equivalence is more
important than exact lexical overlap, making it a more sophisticated alternative
to `response_match_score`.

### Details

This criterion uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge to determine if the
agent's final response is semantically equivalent to the provided reference
response. It is designed to be more flexible than lexical matching metrics (like
`response_match_score`), as it focuses on whether the agent's response contains
the correct information, while tolerating differences in formatting, phrasing,
or the inclusion of additional correct details.

For each invocation, the criterion prompts a judge LLM to rate the agent's
response as "valid" or "invalid" compared to the reference. This is repeated
multiple times for robustness (configurable via `num_samples`), and a majority
vote determines if the invocation receives a score of 1.0 (valid) or 0.0
(invalid). The final criterion score is the fraction of invocations deemed valid
across the entire eval case.

### How To Use This Criterion?

This criterion uses `LlmAsAJudgeCriterion`, allowing you to configure the
evaluation threshold, the judge model, and the number of samples per invocation.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "final_response_match_v2": {
      "threshold": 0.8,
      "judge_model_options": {
            "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
            "num_samples": 5
          }
        }
    }
  }
}
```

### Output And How To Interpret

The criterion returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0. A score of 1.0 means the LLM
judge considered the agent's final response to be valid for all invocations,
while a score closer to 0.0 indicates that many responses were judged as invalid
when compared to the reference responses. Higher values are better.

## rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1

This criterion assesses the quality of an agent's final response against a
user-defined set of rubrics using LLM as a judge.

### When To Use This Criterion?

Use this criterion when you need to evaluate aspects of response quality that go
beyond simple correctness or semantic equivalence with a reference. It is ideal
for assessing nuanced attributes like tone, style, helpfulness, or adherence to
specific conversational guidelines defined in your rubrics. This criterion is
particularly useful when no single reference response exists, or when quality
depends on multiple subjective factors.

### Details

This criterion provides a flexible way to evaluate response quality based on
specific criteria that you define as rubrics. For example, you could define
rubrics to check if a response is concise, if it correctly infers user intent,
or if it avoids jargon.

The criterion uses an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the agent's final response
against each rubric, producing a `yes` (1.0) or `no` (0.0) verdict for each.
Like other LLM-based metrics, it samples the judge model multiple times per
invocation and uses a majority vote to determine the score for each rubric in
that invocation. The overall score for an invocation is the average of its
rubric scores. The final criterion score for the eval case is the average of
these overall scores across all invocations.

### How To Use This Criterion?

This criterion uses `RubricsBasedCriterion`, which requires a list of rubrics to
be provided in the `EvalConfig`. Each rubric should be defined with a unique ID
and its content.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1": {
      "threshold": 0.8,
      "judge_model_options": {
        "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
        "num_samples": 5
      },
      "rubrics": [
        {
          "rubric_id": "conciseness",
          "rubric_content": {
            "text_property": "The agent's response is direct and to the point."
          }
        },
        {
          "rubric_id": "intent_inference",
          "rubric_content": {
            "text_property": "The agent's response accurately infers the user's underlying goal from ambiguous queries."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Output And How To Interpret

The criterion outputs an overall score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates
that the agent's responses satisfied all rubrics across all invocations, and 0.0
indicates that no rubrics were satisfied. The results also include detailed
per-rubric scores for each invocation. Higher values are better.

## rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1

This criterion assesses the quality of an agent's tool usage against a
user-defined set of rubrics using LLM as a judge.

### When To Use This Criterion?

Use this criterion when you need to evaluate *how* an agent uses tools, rather
than just *if* the final response is correct. It is ideal for assessing whether
the agent selected the right tool, used the correct parameters, or followed a
specific sequence of tool calls. This is useful for validating agent reasoning
processes, debugging tool-use errors, and ensuring adherence to prescribed
workflows, especially in cases where multiple tool-use paths could lead to a
similar final answer but only one path is considered correct.

### Details

This criterion provides a flexible way to evaluate tool usage based on specific
rules that you define as rubrics. For example, you could define rubrics to check
if a specific tool was called, if its parameters were correct, or if tools were
called in a particular order.

The criterion uses an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the agent's tool calls and
responses against each rubric, producing a `yes` (1.0) or `no` (0.0) verdict for
each. Like other LLM-based metrics, it samples the judge model multiple times
per invocation and uses a majority vote to determine the score for each rubric
in that invocation. The overall score for an invocation is the average of its
rubric scores. The final criterion score for the eval case is the average of
these overall scores across all invocations.

### How To Use This Criterion?

This criterion uses `RubricsBasedCriterion`, which requires a list of rubrics to
be provided in the `EvalConfig`. Each rubric should be defined with a unique ID
and its content, describing a specific aspect of tool use to evaluate.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1": {
      "threshold": 1.0,
      "judge_model_options": {
        "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
        "num_samples": 5
      },
      "rubrics": [
        {
          "rubric_id": "geocoding_called",
          "rubric_content": {
            "text_property": "The agent calls the GeoCoding tool before calling the GetWeather tool."
          }
        },
        {
          "rubric_id": "getweather_called",
          "rubric_content": {
            "text_property": "The agent calls the GetWeather tool with coordinates derived from the user's location."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Output And How To Interpret

The criterion outputs an overall score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates
that the agent's tool usage satisfied all rubrics across all invocations, and
0.0 indicates that no rubrics were satisfied. The results also include detailed
per-rubric scores for each invocation. Higher values are better.

## hallucinations_v1

This criterion assesses whether a model response contains any false,
contradictory, or unsupported claims.

### When To Use This Criterion?

Use this criterion to ensure the agent's response is grounded in the provided
context (e.g., tool outputs, user query, instructions) and does not contain
hallucinations.

### Details

This criterion assesses whether a model response contains any false,
contradictory, or unsupported claims based on context that includes developer
instructions, user prompt, tool definitions, and tool invocations and their
results. It uses LLM-as-a-judge and follows a two-step process:

1.  **Segmenter**: Segments the agent response into individual sentences.
2.  **Sentence Validator**: Evaluates each segmented sentence against the
    provided context for grounding. Each sentence is labeled as `supported`,
    `unsupported`, `contradictory`, `disputed` or `not_applicable`.

The metric computes an Accuracy Score: the percentage of sentences that are
`supported` or `not_applicable`. By default, only the final response is
evaluated. If `evaluate_intermediate_nl_responses` is set to true in the
criterion, intermediate natural language responses from agents are also
evaluated.

### How To Use This Criterion?

This criterion uses `HallucinationsCriterion`, allowing you to configure the
evaluation threshold, the judge model, the number of samples per invocation and
whether to evaluate intermediate natural language responses.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "hallucinations_v1": {
      "threshold": 0.8,
      "judge_model_options": {
            "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
          },
      "evaluate_intermediate_nl_responses": true
    }
  }
}

```

### Output And How To Interpret

The criterion returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0. A score of 1.0 means all
sentences in agent's response are grounded in the context, while a score closer
to 0.0 indicates that many sentences are false, contradictory, or unsupported.
Higher values are better.

## safety_v1

This criterion evaluates the safety (harmlessness) of an Agent's Response.

### When To Use This Criterion?

This criterion should be used when you need to ensure that agent responses
comply with safety guidelines and do not produce harmful or inappropriate
content. It is essential for user-facing applications or any system where
response safety is a priority.

### Details

This criterion assesses whether the agent's response contains any harmful
content, such as hate speech, harassment, or dangerous information. Unlike other
metrics implemented natively within ADK, `safety_v1` delegates the evaluation to
the Vertex AI General AI Eval SDK.

### How To Use This Criterion?

Using this criterion requires a Google Cloud Project. You must have
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` environment variables set,
typically in an `.env` file in your agent's directory, for the Vertex AI SDK to
function correctly.

You can specify a threshold for this criterion in `EvalConfig` under the
`criteria` dictionary. The value should be a float between 0.0 and 1.0,
representing the minimum safety score for a response to be considered passing.

Example `EvalConfig` entry:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "safety_v1": 0.8
  }
}
```

### Output And How To Interpret

The criterion returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0. Scores closer to 1.0 indicate
that the response is safe, while scores closer to 0.0 indicate potential safety
issues.

# Why Evaluate Agents

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

In traditional software development, unit tests and integration tests provide confidence that code functions as expected and remains stable through changes. These tests provide a clear "pass/fail" signal, guiding further development. However, LLM agents introduce a level of variability that makes traditional testing approaches insufficient.

Due to the probabilistic nature of models, deterministic "pass/fail" assertions are often unsuitable for evaluating agent performance. Instead, we need qualitative evaluations of both the final output and the agent's trajectory \- the sequence of steps taken to reach the solution. This involves assessing the quality of the agent's decisions, its reasoning process, and the final result.

This may seem like a lot of extra work to set up, but the investment of automating evaluations pays off quickly. If you intend to progress beyond prototype, this is a highly recommended best practice.

![intro_components.png](../assets/evaluate_agent.png)

## Preparing for Agent Evaluations

Before automating agent evaluations, define clear objectives and success criteria:

* **Define Success:** What constitutes a successful outcome for your agent?  
* **Identify Critical Tasks:** What are the essential tasks your agent must accomplish?  
* **Choose Relevant Metrics:** What metrics will you track to measure performance?

These considerations will guide the creation of evaluation scenarios and enable effective monitoring of agent behavior in real-world deployments.

## What to Evaluate?

To bridge the gap between a proof-of-concept and a production-ready AI agent, a robust and automated evaluation framework is essential. Unlike evaluating generative models, where the focus is primarily on the final output, agent evaluation requires a deeper understanding of the decision-making process. Agent evaluation can be broken down into two components:

1. **Evaluating Trajectory and Tool Use:** Analyzing the steps an agent takes to reach a solution, including its choice of tools, strategies, and the efficiency of its approach.  
2. **Evaluating the Final Response:** Assessing the quality, relevance, and correctness of the agent's final output.

The trajectory is just a list of steps the agent took before it returned to the user. We can compare that against the list of steps we expect the agent to have taken.

### Evaluating trajectory and tool use

Before responding to a user, an agent typically performs a series of actions, which we refer to as a 'trajectory.' It might compare the user input with session history to disambiguate a term, or lookup a policy document, search a knowledge base or invoke an API to save a ticket. We call this a ‘trajectory’ of actions. Evaluating an agent's performance requires comparing its actual trajectory to an expected, or ideal, one. This comparison can reveal errors and inefficiencies in the agent's process. The expected trajectory represents the ground truth \-- the list of steps we anticipate the agent should take.

For example:

```python
# Trajectory evaluation will compare
expected_steps = ["determine_intent", "use_tool", "review_results", "report_generation"]
actual_steps = ["determine_intent", "use_tool", "review_results", "report_generation"]
```

Several ground-truth-based trajectory evaluations exist:

1. **Exact match:** Requires a perfect match to the ideal trajectory.  
2. **In-order match:** Requires the correct actions in the correct order, allows for extra actions.  
3. **Any-order match:** Requires the correct actions in any order, allows for extra actions.  
4. **Precision:** Measures the relevance/correctness of predicted actions.  
5. **Recall:** Measures how many essential actions are captured in the prediction.  
6. **Single-tool use:** Checks for the inclusion of a specific action.

Choosing the right evaluation metric depends on the specific requirements and goals of your agent. For instance, in high-stakes scenarios, an exact match might be crucial, while in more flexible situations, an in-order or any-order match might suffice.

## How Evaluation works with the ADK

The ADK offers two methods for evaluating agent performance against predefined datasets and evaluation criteria. While conceptually similar, they differ in the amount of data they can process, which typically dictates the appropriate use case for each.

### First approach: Using a test file

This approach involves creating individual test files, each representing a single, simple agent-model interaction (a session). It's most effective during active agent development, serving as a form of unit testing. These tests are designed for rapid execution and should focus on simple session complexity. Each test file contains a single session, which may consist of multiple turns. A turn represents a single interaction between the user and the agent. Each turn includes

-   `User Content`: The user issued query.
-   `Expected Intermediate Tool Use Trajectory`: The tool calls we expect the
    agent to make in order to respond correctly to the user query.
-   `Expected Intermediate Agent Responses`: These are the natural language
    responses that the agent (or sub-agents) generates as it moves towards
    generating a final answer. These natural language responses are usually an
    artifact of an multi-agent system, where your root agent depends on sub-agents to achieve a goal. These intermediate responses, may or may not be of
    interest to the end user, but for a developer/owner of the system, are of
    critical importance, as they give you the confidence that the agent went
    through the right path to generate final response.
-   `Final Response`: The expected final response from the agent.

You can give the file any name for example `evaluation.test.json`.The framework only checks for the `.test.json` suffix, and the preceding part of the filename is not constrained. The test files are backed by a formal Pydantic data model. The two key schema files are
[Eval Set](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/evaluation/eval_set.py) and
[Eval Case](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/evaluation/eval_case.py).
Here is a test file with a few examples:

*(Note: Comments are included for explanatory purposes and should be removed for the JSON to be valid.)*

```json
# Do note that some fields are removed for sake of making this doc readable.
{
  "eval_set_id": "home_automation_agent_light_on_off_set",
  "name": "",
  "description": "This is an eval set that is used for unit testing `x` behavior of the Agent",
  "eval_cases": [
    {
      "eval_id": "eval_case_id",
      "conversation": [
        {
          "invocation_id": "b7982664-0ab6-47cc-ab13-326656afdf75", # Unique identifier for the invocation.
          "user_content": { # Content provided by the user in this invocation. This is the query.
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": "Turn off device_2 in the Bedroom."
              }
            ],
            "role": "user"
          },
          "final_response": { # Final response from the agent that acts as a reference of benchmark.
            "parts": [
              {
                "text": "I have set the device_2 status to off."
              }
            ],
            "role": "model"
          },
          "intermediate_data": {
            "tool_uses": [ # Tool use trajectory in chronological order.
              {
                "args": {
                  "location": "Bedroom",
                  "device_id": "device_2",
                  "status": "OFF"
                },
                "name": "set_device_info"
              }
            ],
            "intermediate_responses": [] # Any intermediate sub-agent responses.
          },
        }
      ],
      "session_input": { # Initial session input.
        "app_name": "home_automation_agent",
        "user_id": "test_user",
        "state": {}
      },
    }
  ],
}
```

Test files can be organized into folders. Optionally, a folder can also include a `test_config.json` file that specifies the evaluation criteria.

#### How to migrate test files not backed by the Pydantic schema?

NOTE: If your test files don't adhere to [EvalSet](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/evaluation/eval_set.py) schema file, then this section is relevant to you.

Please use `AgentEvaluator.migrate_eval_data_to_new_schema` to migrate your
existing `*.test.json` files to the Pydantic backed schema.

The utility takes your current test data file and an optional initial session
file, and generates a single output json file with data serialized in the new
format. Given that the new schema is more cohesive, both the old test data file
and initial session file can be ignored (or removed.)

### Second approach: Using An Evalset File

The evalset approach utilizes a dedicated dataset called an "evalset" for evaluating agent-model interactions. Similar to a test file, the evalset contains example interactions. However, an evalset can contain multiple, potentially lengthy sessions, making it ideal for simulating complex, multi-turn conversations. Due to its ability to represent complex sessions, the evalset is well-suited for integration tests. These tests are typically run less frequently than unit tests due to their more extensive nature.

An evalset file contains multiple "evals," each representing a distinct session. Each eval consists of one or more "turns," which include the user query, expected tool use, expected intermediate agent responses, and a reference response. These fields have the same meaning as they do in the test file approach. Each eval is identified by a unique name. Furthermore, each eval includes an associated initial session state.

Creating evalsets manually can be complex, therefore UI tools are provided to help capture relevant sessions and easily convert them into evals within your evalset. Learn more about using the web UI for evaluation below. Here is an example evalset containing two sessions. The eval set files are  backed by a formal Pydantic data model. The two key schema files are
[Eval Set](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/evaluation/eval_set.py) and
[Eval Case](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/evaluation/eval_case.py).

!!! warning
    This evalset evaluation method requires the use of a paid service,
    [Vertex Gen AI Evaluation Service API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/evaluation).

#### How to migrate eval set files not backed by the Pydantic schema?

NOTE: If your eval set files don't adhere to [EvalSet](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/evaluation/eval_set.py) schema file, then this section is relevant to you.

Based on who is maintaining the eval set data, there are two routes:

1.  **Eval set data maintained by ADK UI** If you use ADK UI to maintain your
    Eval set data then *no action is needed* from you.

2.  **Eval set data is developed and maintained manually and used in ADK eval CLI** A
    migration tool is in the works, until then the ADK eval CLI command will
    continue to support data in the old format.

### Evaluation Criteria

ADK provides several built-in criterion for evaluating agent performance, ranging
from tool trajectory matching to LLM-based response quality assessment. For a
detailed list of available criteria and guidance on when to use them, please see
[Evaluation Criteria](./criteria.md).

Here is a summary of all the available criteria:

*   **tool_trajectory_avg_score**: Exact match of tool call trajectory.
*   **response_match_score**: ROUGE-1 similarity to reference response.
*   **final_response_match_v2**: LLM-judged semantic match to a reference
    response.
*   **rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1**: LLM-judged final response
    quality based on custom rubrics.
*   **rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1**: LLM-judged tool usage quality based on
    custom rubrics.
*   **hallucinations_v1**: LLM-judged groundedness of agent response against
    context.
*   **safety_v1**: Safety/harmlessness of agent response.

If no evaluation criteria are provided, the following default configuration is used:

* `tool_trajectory_avg_score`: Defaults to 1.0, requiring a 100% match in the tool usage trajectory.  
* `response_match_score`: Defaults to 0.8, allowing for a small margin of error in the agent's natural language responses.

Here is an example of a `test_config.json` file specifying custom evaluation criteria:

```json
{
  "criteria": {
    "tool_trajectory_avg_score": 1.0,
    "response_match_score": 0.8
  }
}
```

#### Recommendations on Criteria

Choose criteria based on your evaluation goals:

*   **Enable tests in CI/CD pipelines or regression testing:** Use
    `tool_trajectory_avg_score` and `response_match_score`. These criteria are
    fast, predictable, and suitable for frequent automated checks.
*   **Evaluate trusted reference responses:** Use `final_response_match_v2` to
    evaluate semantic equivalence. This LLM-based check is more flexible than
    exact matching and better captures whether the agent's response means the
    same thing as the reference response.
*   **Evaluate response quality without a reference response:** Use
    `rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1`. This is useful when you don't have
    a trusted reference, but you can define attributes of a good response (e.g.,
    "The response is concise," "The response has a helpful tone").
*   **Evaluate the correctness of tool usage:** Use
    `rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1`. This allows you to validate the agent's
    reasoning process by checking, for example, that a specific tool was called
    or that tools were called in the correct order (e.g., "Tool A must be called
    before Tool B").
*   **Check if responses are grounded in context:** Use `hallucinations_v1` to
    detect if the agent makes claims that are unsupported by or contradictory to
    the information available to it (e.g., tool outputs).
*   **Check for harmful content:** Use `safety_v1` to ensure that agent
    responses are safe and do not violate safety policies.


## How to run Evaluation with the ADK

As a developer, you can evaluate your agents using the ADK in the following ways:

1. **Web-based UI (**`adk web`**):** Evaluate agents interactively through a web-based interface.  
2. **Programmatically (**`pytest`**)**: Integrate evaluation into your testing pipeline using `pytest` and test files.  
3. **Command Line Interface (**`adk eval`**):** Run evaluations on an existing evaluation set file directly from the command line.

### 1\. `adk web` \- Run Evaluations via the Web UI

The web UI provides an interactive way to evaluate agents, generate evaluation datasets, and inspect agent behavior in detail.

#### Step 1: Create and Save a Test Case

1. Start the web server by running: `adk web <path_to_your_agents_folder>`
2. In the web interface, select an agent and interact with it to create a session.
3. Navigate to the **Eval** tab on the right side of the interface.
4. Create a new eval set or select an existing one.
5. Click **"Add current session"** to save the conversation as a new evaluation case.

#### Step 2: View and Edit Your Test Case

Once a case is saved, you can click its ID in the list to inspect it. To make changes, click the **Edit current eval case** icon (pencil). This interactive view allows you to:

* **Modify** agent text responses to refine test scenarios.
* **Delete** individual agent messages from the conversation.
* **Delete** the entire evaluation case if it's no longer needed.

![adk-eval-case.gif](../assets/adk-eval-case.gif)

#### Step 3: Run the Evaluation with Custom Metrics

1. Select one or more test cases from your evalset.
2. Click **Run Evaluation**. An **EVALUATION METRIC** dialog will appear.
3. In the dialog, use the sliders to configure the thresholds for:
    * **Tool trajectory avg score**
    * **Response match score**
4. Click **Start** to run the evaluation using your custom criteria. The evaluation history will record the metrics used for each run.

![adk-eval-config.gif](../assets/adk-eval-config.gif)

#### Step 4: Analyze Results

After the run completes, you can analyze the results:

* **Analyze Run Failures**: Click on any **Pass** or **Fail** result. For failures, you can hover over the `Fail` label to see a side-by-side comparison of the **Actual vs. Expected Output** and the scores that caused the failure.

### Debugging with the Trace View

The ADK web UI includes a powerful **Trace** tab for debugging agent behavior. This feature is available for any agent session, not just during evaluation.

The **Trace** tab provides a detailed and interactive way to inspect your agent's execution flow. Traces are automatically grouped by user message, making it easy to follow the chain of events.

Each trace row is interactive:

* **Hovering** over a trace row highlights the corresponding message in the chat window.
* **Clicking** on a trace row opens a detailed inspection panel with four tabs:
    * **Event**: The raw event data.
    * **Request**: The request sent to the model.
    * **Response**: The response received from the model.
    * **Graph**: A visual representation of the tool calls and agent logic flow.

![adk-trace1.gif](../assets/adk-trace1.gif)
![adk-trace2.gif](../assets/adk-trace2.gif)

Blue rows in the trace view indicate that an event was generated from that interaction. Clicking on these blue rows will open the bottom event detail panel, providing deeper insights into the agent's execution flow.

### 2\.  `pytest` \- Run Tests Programmatically

You can also use **`pytest`** to run test files as part of your integration tests.

#### Example Command

```shell
pytest tests/integration/
```

#### Example Test Code

Here is an example of a `pytest` test case that runs a single test file:

```py
from google.adk.evaluation.agent_evaluator import AgentEvaluator
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_with_single_test_file():
    """Test the agent's basic ability via a session file."""
    await AgentEvaluator.evaluate(
        agent_module="home_automation_agent",
        eval_dataset_file_path_or_dir="tests/integration/fixture/home_automation_agent/simple_test.test.json",
    )
```

This approach allows you to integrate agent evaluations into your CI/CD pipelines or larger test suites. If you want to specify the initial session state for your tests, you can do that by storing the session details in a file and passing that to `AgentEvaluator.evaluate` method.

### 3\. `adk eval` \- Run Evaluations via the CLI

You can also run evaluation of an eval set file through the command line interface (CLI). This runs the same evaluation that runs on the UI, but it helps with automation, i.e. you can add this command as a part of your regular build generation and verification process.

Here is the command:

```shell
adk eval \
    <AGENT_MODULE_FILE_PATH> \
    <EVAL_SET_FILE_PATH> \
    [--config_file_path=<PATH_TO_TEST_JSON_CONFIG_FILE>] \
    [--print_detailed_results]
```

For example:

```shell
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```

Here are the details for each command line argument:

* `AGENT_MODULE_FILE_PATH`: The path to the `__init__.py` file that contains a module by the name "agent". "agent" module contains a `root_agent`.  
* `EVAL_SET_FILE_PATH`: The path to evaluations file(s). You can specify one or more eval set file paths. For each file, all evals will be run by default. If you want to run only specific evals from a eval set, first create a comma separated list of eval names and then add that as a suffix to the eval set file name, demarcated by a colon `:` .
* For example: `sample_eval_set_file.json:eval_1,eval_2,eval_3`  
  `This will only run eval_1, eval_2 and eval_3 from sample_eval_set_file.json`  
* `CONFIG_FILE_PATH`: The path to the config file.  
* `PRINT_DETAILED_RESULTS`: Prints detailed results on the console.

# Events

Events are the fundamental units of information flow within the Agent Development Kit (ADK). They represent every significant occurrence during an agent's interaction lifecycle, from initial user input to the final response and all the steps in between. Understanding events is crucial because they are the primary way components communicate, state is managed, and control flow is directed.

## What Events Are and Why They Matter

An `Event` in ADK is an immutable record representing a specific point in the agent's execution. It captures user messages, agent replies, requests to use tools (function calls), tool results, state changes, control signals, and errors.

=== "Python"
    Technically, it's an instance of the `google.adk.events.Event` class, which builds upon the basic `LlmResponse` structure by adding essential ADK-specific metadata and an `actions` payload.

    ```python
    # Conceptual Structure of an Event (Python)
    # from google.adk.events import Event, EventActions
    # from google.genai import types

    # class Event(LlmResponse): # Simplified view
    #     # --- LlmResponse fields ---
    #     content: Optional[types.Content]
    #     partial: Optional[bool]
    #     # ... other response fields ...

    #     # --- ADK specific additions ---
    #     author: str          # 'user' or agent name
    #     invocation_id: str   # ID for the whole interaction run
    #     id: str              # Unique ID for this specific event
    #     timestamp: float     # Creation time
    #     actions: EventActions # Important for side-effects & control
    #     branch: Optional[str] # Hierarchy path
    #     # ...
    ```

=== "Java"
    In Java, this is an instance of the `com.google.adk.events.Event` class. It also builds upon a basic response structure by adding essential ADK-specific metadata and an `actions` payload.

    ```java
    // Conceptual Structure of an Event (Java - See com.google.adk.events.Event.java)
    // Simplified view based on the provided com.google.adk.events.Event.java
    // public class Event extends JsonBaseModel {
    //     // --- Fields analogous to LlmResponse ---
    //     private Optional<Content> content;
    //     private Optional<Boolean> partial;
    //     // ... other response fields like errorCode, errorMessage ...

    //     // --- ADK specific additions ---
    //     private String author;         // 'user' or agent name
    //     private String invocationId;   // ID for the whole interaction run
    //     private String id;             // Unique ID for this specific event
    //     private long timestamp;        // Creation time (epoch milliseconds)
    //     private EventActions actions;  // Important for side-effects & control
    //     private Optional<String> branch; // Hierarchy path
    //     // ... other fields like turnComplete, longRunningToolIds etc.
    // }
    ```

Events are central to ADK's operation for several key reasons:

1.  **Communication:** They serve as the standard message format between the user interface, the `Runner`, agents, the LLM, and tools. Everything flows as an `Event`.

2.  **Signaling State & Artifact Changes:** Events carry instructions for state modifications and track artifact updates. The `SessionService` uses these signals to ensure persistence. In Python changes are signaled via `event.actions.state_delta` and `event.actions.artifact_delta`.

3.  **Control Flow:** Specific fields like `event.actions.transfer_to_agent` or `event.actions.escalate` act as signals that direct the framework, determining which agent runs next or if a loop should terminate.

4.  **History & Observability:** The sequence of events recorded in `session.events` provides a complete, chronological history of an interaction, invaluable for debugging, auditing, and understanding agent behavior step-by-step.

In essence, the entire process, from a user's query to the agent's final answer, is orchestrated through the generation, interpretation, and processing of `Event` objects.


## Understanding and Using Events

As a developer, you'll primarily interact with the stream of events yielded by the `Runner`. Here's how to understand and extract information from them:

!!! Note
    The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `event.content()` in Python, `event.content().get().parts()` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Identifying Event Origin and Type

Quickly determine what an event represents by checking:

*   **Who sent it? (`event.author`)**
    *   `'user'`: Indicates input directly from the end-user.
    *   `'AgentName'`: Indicates output or action from a specific agent (e.g., `'WeatherAgent'`, `'SummarizerAgent'`).
*   **What's the main payload? (`event.content` and `event.content.parts`)**
    *   **Text:** Indicates a conversational message. For Python, check if `event.content.parts[0].text` exists. For Java, check if `event.content()` is present, its `parts()` are present and not empty, and the first part's `text()` is present.
    *   **Tool Call Request:** Check `event.get_function_calls()`. If not empty, the LLM is asking to execute one or more tools. Each item in the list has `.name` and `.args`.
    *   **Tool Result:** Check `event.get_function_responses()`. If not empty, this event carries the result(s) from tool execution(s). Each item has `.name` and `.response` (the dictionary returned by the tool). *Note:* For history structuring, the `role` inside the `content` is often `'user'`, but the event `author` is typically the agent that requested the tool call.

*   **Is it streaming output? (`event.partial`)**
    Indicates whether this is an incomplete chunk of text from the LLM.
    *   `True`: More text will follow.
    *   `False` or `None`/`Optional.empty()`: This part of the content is complete (though the overall turn might not be finished if `turn_complete` is also false).

=== "Python"
    ```python
    # Pseudocode: Basic event identification (Python)
    # async for event in runner.run_async(...):
    #     print(f"Event from: {event.author}")
    #
    #     if event.content and event.content.parts:
    #         if event.get_function_calls():
    #             print("  Type: Tool Call Request")
    #         elif event.get_function_responses():
    #             print("  Type: Tool Result")
    #         elif event.content.parts[0].text:
    #             if event.partial:
    #                 print("  Type: Streaming Text Chunk")
    #             else:
    #                 print("  Type: Complete Text Message")
    #         else:
    #             print("  Type: Other Content (e.g., code result)")
    #     elif event.actions and (event.actions.state_delta or event.actions.artifact_delta):
    #         print("  Type: State/Artifact Update")
    #     else:
    #         print("  Type: Control Signal or Other")
    ```

=== "Java"
    ```java
    // Pseudocode: Basic event identification (Java)
    // import com.google.genai.types.Content;
    // import com.google.adk.events.Event;
    // import com.google.adk.events.EventActions;

    // runner.runAsync(...).forEach(event -> { // Assuming a synchronous stream or reactive stream
    //     System.out.println("Event from: " + event.author());
    //
    //     if (event.content().isPresent()) {
    //         Content content = event.content().get();
    //         if (!event.functionCalls().isEmpty()) {
    //             System.out.println("  Type: Tool Call Request");
    //         } else if (!event.functionResponses().isEmpty()) {
    //             System.out.println("  Type: Tool Result");
    //         } else if (content.parts().isPresent() && !content.parts().get().isEmpty() &&
    //                    content.parts().get().get(0).text().isPresent()) {
    //             if (event.partial().orElse(false)) {
    //                 System.out.println("  Type: Streaming Text Chunk");
    //             } else {
    //                 System.out.println("  Type: Complete Text Message");
    //             }
    //         } else {
    //             System.out.println("  Type: Other Content (e.g., code result)");
    //         }
    //     } else if (event.actions() != null &&
    //                ((event.actions().stateDelta() != null && !event.actions().stateDelta().isEmpty()) ||
    //                 (event.actions().artifactDelta() != null && !event.actions().artifactDelta().isEmpty()))) {
    //         System.out.println("  Type: State/Artifact Update");
    //     } else {
    //         System.out.println("  Type: Control Signal or Other");
    //     }
    // });
    ```

### Extracting Key Information

Once you know the event type, access the relevant data:

*   **Text Content:**
    Always check for the presence of content and parts before accessing text. In Python its `text = event.content.parts[0].text`.

*   **Function Call Details:**
    
    === "Python"
        ```python
        calls = event.get_function_calls()
        if calls:
            for call in calls:
                tool_name = call.name
                arguments = call.args # This is usually a dictionary
                print(f"  Tool: {tool_name}, Args: {arguments}")
                # Application might dispatch execution based on this
        ```
    === "Java"

        ```java
        import com.google.genai.types.FunctionCall;
        import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
        import java.util.Map;
    
        ImmutableList<FunctionCall> calls = event.functionCalls(); // from Event.java
        if (!calls.isEmpty()) {
          for (FunctionCall call : calls) {
            String toolName = call.name().get();
            // args is Optional<Map<String, Object>>
            Map<String, Object> arguments = call.args().get();
                   System.out.println("  Tool: " + toolName + ", Args: " + arguments);
            // Application might dispatch execution based on this
          }
        }
        ```

*   **Function Response Details:**
    
    === "Python"
        ```python
        responses = event.get_function_responses()
        if responses:
            for response in responses:
                tool_name = response.name
                result_dict = response.response # The dictionary returned by the tool
                print(f"  Tool Result: {tool_name} -> {result_dict}")
        ```
    === "Java"

        ```java
        import com.google.genai.types.FunctionResponse;
        import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
        import java.util.Map; 

        ImmutableList<FunctionResponse> responses = event.functionResponses(); // from Event.java
        if (!responses.isEmpty()) {
            for (FunctionResponse response : responses) {
                String toolName = response.name().get();
                Map<String, String> result= response.response().get(); // Check before getting the response
                System.out.println("  Tool Result: " + toolName + " -> " + result);
            }
        }
        ```

*   **Identifiers:**
    *   `event.id`: Unique ID for this specific event instance.
    *   `event.invocation_id`: ID for the entire user-request-to-final-response cycle this event belongs to. Useful for logging and tracing.

### Detecting Actions and Side Effects

The `event.actions` object signals changes that occurred or should occur. Always check if `event.actions` and it's fields/ methods exists before accessing them.

*   **State Changes:** Gives you a collection of key-value pairs that were modified in the session state during the step that produced this event.
    
    === "Python"
        `delta = event.actions.state_delta` (a dictionary of `{key: value}` pairs).
        ```python
        if event.actions and event.actions.state_delta:
            print(f"  State changes: {event.actions.state_delta}")
            # Update local UI or application state if necessary
        ```
    === "Java"
        `ConcurrentMap<String, Object> delta = event.actions().stateDelta();`

        ```java
        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;
        import com.google.adk.events.EventActions;

        EventActions actions = event.actions(); // Assuming event.actions() is not null
        if (actions != null && actions.stateDelta() != null && !actions.stateDelta().isEmpty()) {
            ConcurrentMap<String, Object> stateChanges = actions.stateDelta();
            System.out.println("  State changes: " + stateChanges);
            // Update local UI or application state if necessary
        }
        ```

*   **Artifact Saves:** Gives you a collection indicating which artifacts were saved and their new version number (or relevant `Part` information).
    
    === "Python"
        `artifact_changes = event.actions.artifact_delta` (a dictionary of `{filename: version}`).
        ```python
        if event.actions and event.actions.artifact_delta:
            print(f"  Artifacts saved: {event.actions.artifact_delta}")
            # UI might refresh an artifact list
        ```
    === "Java"
        `ConcurrentMap<String, Part> artifactChanges = event.actions().artifactDelta();`
        
        ```java
        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;
        import com.google.genai.types.Part;
        import com.google.adk.events.EventActions;

        EventActions actions = event.actions(); // Assuming event.actions() is not null
        if (actions != null && actions.artifactDelta() != null && !actions.artifactDelta().isEmpty()) {
            ConcurrentMap<String, Part> artifactChanges = actions.artifactDelta();
            System.out.println("  Artifacts saved: " + artifactChanges);
            // UI might refresh an artifact list
            // Iterate through artifactChanges.entrySet() to get filename and Part details
        }
        ```

*   **Control Flow Signals:** Check boolean flags or string values:
    
    === "Python"
        *   `event.actions.transfer_to_agent` (string): Control should pass to the named agent.
        *   `event.actions.escalate` (bool): A loop should terminate.
        *   `event.actions.skip_summarization` (bool): A tool result should not be summarized by the LLM.
        ```python
        if event.actions:
            if event.actions.transfer_to_agent:
                print(f"  Signal: Transfer to {event.actions.transfer_to_agent}")
            if event.actions.escalate:
                print("  Signal: Escalate (terminate loop)")
            if event.actions.skip_summarization:
                print("  Signal: Skip summarization for tool result")
        ```
    === "Java"
        *   `event.actions().transferToAgent()` (returns `Optional<String>`): Control should pass to the named agent.
        *   `event.actions().escalate()` (returns `Optional<Boolean>`): A loop should terminate.
        *   `event.actions().skipSummarization()` (returns `Optional<Boolean>`): A tool result should not be summarized by the LLM.

        ```java
        import com.google.adk.events.EventActions;
        import java.util.Optional;

        EventActions actions = event.actions(); // Assuming event.actions() is not null
        if (actions != null) {
            Optional<String> transferAgent = actions.transferToAgent();
            if (transferAgent.isPresent()) {
                System.out.println("  Signal: Transfer to " + transferAgent.get());
            }

            Optional<Boolean> escalate = actions.escalate();
            if (escalate.orElse(false)) { // or escalate.isPresent() && escalate.get()
                System.out.println("  Signal: Escalate (terminate loop)");
            }

            Optional<Boolean> skipSummarization = actions.skipSummarization();
            if (skipSummarization.orElse(false)) { // or skipSummarization.isPresent() && skipSummarization.get()
                System.out.println("  Signal: Skip summarization for tool result");
            }
        }
        ```

### Determining if an Event is a "Final" Response

Use the built-in helper method `event.is_final_response()` to identify events suitable for display as the agent's complete output for a turn.

*   **Purpose:** Filters out intermediate steps (like tool calls, partial streaming text, internal state updates) from the final user-facing message(s).
*   **When `True`?**
    1.  The event contains a tool result (`function_response`) and `skip_summarization` is `True`.
    2.  The event contains a tool call (`function_call`) for a tool marked as `is_long_running=True`. In Java, check if the `longRunningToolIds` list is empty: 
        *   `event.longRunningToolIds().isPresent() && !event.longRunningToolIds().get().isEmpty()` is `true`.
    3.  OR, **all** of the following are met:
        *   No function calls (`get_function_calls()` is empty).
        *   No function responses (`get_function_responses()` is empty).
        *   Not a partial stream chunk (`partial` is not `True`).
        *   Doesn't end with a code execution result that might need further processing/display.
*   **Usage:** Filter the event stream in your application logic.

    === "Python"
        ```python
        # Pseudocode: Handling final responses in application (Python)
        # full_response_text = ""
        # async for event in runner.run_async(...):
        #     # Accumulate streaming text if needed...
        #     if event.partial and event.content and event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0].text:
        #         full_response_text += event.content.parts[0].text
        #
        #     # Check if it's a final, displayable event
        #     if event.is_final_response():
        #         print("\n--- Final Output Detected ---")
        #         if event.content and event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0].text:
        #              # If it's the final part of a stream, use accumulated text
        #              final_text = full_response_text + (event.content.parts[0].text if not event.partial else "")
        #              print(f"Display to user: {final_text.strip()}")
        #              full_response_text = "" # Reset accumulator
        #         elif event.actions and event.actions.skip_summarization and event.get_function_responses():
        #              # Handle displaying the raw tool result if needed
        #              response_data = event.get_function_responses()[0].response
        #              print(f"Display raw tool result: {response_data}")
        #         elif hasattr(event, 'long_running_tool_ids') and event.long_running_tool_ids:
        #              print("Display message: Tool is running in background...")
        #         else:
        #              # Handle other types of final responses if applicable
        #              print("Display: Final non-textual response or signal.")
        ```

                     System.out.println("Display raw tool result: " + responseData);
                 } else if (event.longRunningToolIds().isPresent() && !event.longRunningToolIds().get().isEmpty()) {

                 } else {

                     System.out.println("Display: Final non-textual response or signal.");
                 }
             }
         });
        ```

By carefully examining these aspects of an event, you can build robust applications that react appropriately to the rich information flowing through the ADK system.

## How Events Flow: Generation and Processing

Events are created at different points and processed systematically by the framework. Understanding this flow helps clarify how actions and history are managed.

*   **Generation Sources:**
    *   **User Input:** The `Runner` typically wraps initial user messages or mid-conversation inputs into an `Event` with `author='user'`.
    *   **Agent Logic:** Agents (`BaseAgent`, `LlmAgent`) explicitly `yield Event(...)` objects (setting `author=self.name`) to communicate responses or signal actions.
    *   **LLM Responses:** The ADK model integration layer translates raw LLM output (text, function calls, errors) into `Event` objects, authored by the calling agent.
    *   **Tool Results:** After a tool executes, the framework generates an `Event` containing the `function_response`. The `author` is typically the agent that requested the tool, while the `role` inside the `content` is set to `'user'` for the LLM history.


*   **Processing Flow:**
    1.  **Yield/Return:** An event is generated and yielded (Python) or returned/emitted (Java) by its source.
    2.  **Runner Receives:** The main `Runner` executing the agent receives the event.
    3.  **SessionService Processing:** The `Runner` sends the event to the configured `SessionService`. This is a critical step:
        *   **Applies Deltas:** The service merges `event.actions.state_delta` into `session.state` and updates internal records based on `event.actions.artifact_delta`. (Note: The actual artifact *saving* usually happened earlier when `context.save_artifact` was called).
        *   **Finalizes Metadata:** Assigns a unique `event.id` if not present, may update `event.timestamp`.
        *   **Persists to History:** Appends the processed event to the `session.events` list.
    4.  **External Yield:** The `Runner` yields (Python) or returns/emits (Java) the processed event outwards to the calling application (e.g., the code that invoked `runner.run_async`).

This flow ensures that state changes and history are consistently recorded alongside the communication content of each event.


## Common Event Examples (Illustrative Patterns)

Here are concise examples of typical events you might see in the stream:

*   **User Input:**
    ```json
    {
      "author": "user",
      "invocation_id": "e-xyz...",
      "content": {"parts": [{"text": "Book a flight to London for next Tuesday"}]}
      // actions usually empty
    }
    ```
*   **Agent Final Text Response:** (`is_final_response() == True`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "TravelAgent",
      "invocation_id": "e-xyz...",
      "content": {"parts": [{"text": "Okay, I can help with that. Could you confirm the departure city?"}]},
      "partial": false,
      "turn_complete": true
      // actions might have state delta, etc.
    }
    ```
*   **Agent Streaming Text Response:** (`is_final_response() == False`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "SummaryAgent",
      "invocation_id": "e-abc...",
      "content": {"parts": [{"text": "The document discusses three main points:"}]},
      "partial": true,
      "turn_complete": false
    }
    // ... more partial=True events follow ...
    ```
*   **Tool Call Request (by LLM):** (`is_final_response() == False`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "TravelAgent",
      "invocation_id": "e-xyz...",
      "content": {"parts": [{"function_call": {"name": "find_airports", "args": {"city": "London"}}}]}
      // actions usually empty
    }
    ```
*   **Tool Result Provided (to LLM):** (`is_final_response()` depends on `skip_summarization`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "TravelAgent", // Author is agent that requested the call
      "invocation_id": "e-xyz...",
      "content": {
        "role": "user", // Role for LLM history
        "parts": [{"function_response": {"name": "find_airports", "response": {"result": ["LHR", "LGW", "STN"]}}}]
      }
      // actions might have skip_summarization=True
    }
    ```
*   **State/Artifact Update Only:** (`is_final_response() == False`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "InternalUpdater",
      "invocation_id": "e-def...",
      "content": null,
      "actions": {
        "state_delta": {"user_status": "verified"},
        "artifact_delta": {"verification_doc.pdf": 2}
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Agent Transfer Signal:** (`is_final_response() == False`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "OrchestratorAgent",
      "invocation_id": "e-789...",
      "content": {"parts": [{"function_call": {"name": "transfer_to_agent", "args": {"agent_name": "BillingAgent"}}}]},
      "actions": {"transfer_to_agent": "BillingAgent"} // Added by framework
    }
    ```
*   **Loop Escalation Signal:** (`is_final_response() == False`)
    ```json
    {
      "author": "CheckerAgent",
      "invocation_id": "e-loop...",
      "content": {"parts": [{"text": "Maximum retries reached."}]}, // Optional content
      "actions": {"escalate": true}
    }
    ```

## Additional Context and Event Details

Beyond the core concepts, here are a few specific details about context and events that are important for certain use cases:

1.  **`ToolContext.function_call_id` (Linking Tool Actions):**
    *   When an LLM requests a tool (FunctionCall), that request has an ID. The `ToolContext` provided to your tool function includes this `function_call_id`.
    *   **Importance:** This ID is crucial for linking actions like authentication back to the specific tool request that initiated them, especially if multiple tools are called in one turn. The framework uses this ID internally.

2.  **How State/Artifact Changes are Recorded:**
    *   When you modify state or save an artifact using `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`, these changes aren't immediately written to persistent storage.
    *   Instead, they populate the `state_delta` and `artifact_delta` fields within the `EventActions` object.
    *   This `EventActions` object is attached to the *next event* generated after the change (e.g., the agent's response or a tool result event).
    *   The `SessionService.append_event` method reads these deltas from the incoming event and applies them to the session's persistent state and artifact records. This ensures changes are tied chronologically to the event stream.

3.  **State Scope Prefixes (`app:`, `user:`, `temp:`):**
    *   When managing state via `context.state`, you can optionally use prefixes:
        *   `app:my_setting`: Suggests state relevant to the entire application (requires a persistent `SessionService`).
        *   `user:user_preference`: Suggests state relevant to the specific user across sessions (requires a persistent `SessionService`).
        *   `temp:intermediate_result` or no prefix: Typically session-specific or temporary state for the current invocation.
    *   The underlying `SessionService` determines how these prefixes are handled for persistence.

4.  **Error Events:**
    *   An `Event` can represent an error. Check the `event.error_code` and `event.error_message` fields (inherited from `LlmResponse`).
    *   Errors might originate from the LLM (e.g., safety filters, resource limits) or potentially be packaged by the framework if a tool fails critically. Check tool `FunctionResponse` content for typical tool-specific errors.
    ```json
    // Example Error Event (conceptual)
    {
      "author": "LLMAgent",
      "invocation_id": "e-err...",
      "content": null,
      "error_code": "SAFETY_FILTER_TRIGGERED",
      "error_message": "Response blocked due to safety settings.",
      "actions": {}
    }
    ```

These details provide a more complete picture for advanced use cases involving tool authentication, state persistence scope, and error handling within the event stream.

## Best Practices for Working with Events

To use events effectively in your ADK applications:

*   **Clear Authorship:** When building custom agents, ensure correct attribution for agent actions in the history. The framework generally handles authorship correctly for LLM/tool events.
    
    === "Python"
        Use `yield Event(author=self.name, ...)` in `BaseAgent` subclasses.
    === "Java"
        When constructing an `Event` in your custom agent logic, set the author, for example: `Event.builder().author(this.getAgentName()) // ... .build();`

*   **Semantic Content & Actions:** Use `event.content` for the core message/data (text, function call/response). Use `event.actions` specifically for signaling side effects (state/artifact deltas) or control flow (`transfer`, `escalate`, `skip_summarization`).
*   **Idempotency Awareness:** Understand that the `SessionService` is responsible for applying the state/artifact changes signaled in `event.actions`. While ADK services aim for consistency, consider potential downstream effects if your application logic re-processes events.
*   **Use `is_final_response()`:** Rely on this helper method in your application/UI layer to identify complete, user-facing text responses. Avoid manually replicating its logic.
*   **Leverage History:** The session's event list is your primary debugging tool. Examine the sequence of authors, content, and actions to trace execution and diagnose issues.
*   **Use Metadata:** Use `invocation_id` to correlate all events within a single user interaction. Use `event.id` to reference specific, unique occurrences.

Treating events as structured messages with clear purposes for their content and actions is key to building, debugging, and managing complex agent behaviors in ADK.

# Build a streaming agent

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) enables real-time, interactive experiences with your AI agents through streaming. This allows for features like live voice conversations, real-time tool use, and continuous updates from your agent.

This page provides quickstart examples to get you up and running with streaming capabilities in both Python and Java ADK.

# Build a streaming agent with Java

This quickstart guide will walk you through the process of creating a basic agent and leveraging ADK Streaming with Java to facilitate low-latency, bidirectional voice interactions.

You'll begin by setting up your Java and Maven environment, structuring your project, and defining the necessary dependencies. Following this, you'll create a simple `ScienceTeacherAgent`, test its text-based streaming capabilities using the Dev UI, and then progress to enabling live audio communication, transforming your agent into an interactive voice-driven application.

## **Create your first agent** {#create-your-first-agent}

### **Prerequisites**

* In this getting started guide, you will be programming in Java. Check if **Java** is installed on your machine. Ideally, you should be using Java 17 or more (you can check that by typing **java \-version**)

* You’ll also be using the **Maven** build tool for Java. So be sure to have [Maven installed](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) on your machine before going further (this is the case for Cloud Top or Cloud Shell, but not necessarily for your laptop).

### **Prepare the project structure**

To get started with ADK Java, let’s create a Maven project with the following directory structure:

```
adk-agents/
├── pom.xml
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── java/
            └── agents/
                └── ScienceTeacherAgent.java
```

Follow the instructions in [Installation](../../get-started/installation.md) page to add `pom.xml` for using the ADK package.

!!! Note
    Feel free to use whichever name you like for the root directory of your project (instead of adk-agents)

### **Running a compilation**

Let’s see if Maven is happy with this build, by running a compilation (**mvn compile** command):

```shell
$ mvn compile
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO]
[INFO] --------------------< adk-agents:adk-agents >--------------------
[INFO] Building adk-agents 1.0-SNAPSHOT

[INFO] Total time:  1.347 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2025-05-06T15:38:08Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Looks like the project is set up properly for compilation\!

### **Creating an agent**

Create the **ScienceTeacherAgent.java** file under the `src/main/java/agents/` directory with the following content:

```java
package samples.liveaudio;

import com.google.adk.agents.BaseAgent;
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;

/** Science teacher agent. */
public class ScienceTeacherAgent {

  // Field expected by the Dev UI to load the agent dynamically
  // (the agent must be initialized at declaration time)
  public static final BaseAgent ROOT_AGENT = initAgent();

  public static BaseAgent initAgent() {
    return LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("science-app")
        .description("Science teacher agent")
        .model("gemini-2.0-flash-exp")
        .instruction("""
            You are a helpful science teacher that explains
            science concepts to kids and teenagers.
            """)
        .build();
  }
}
```

!!!note "Troubleshooting"

    The model `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` will be deprecated in the future. If you see any issues on using it, try using `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` instead

We will use `Dev UI` to run this agent later. For the tool to automatically recognize the agent, its Java class has to comply with the following two rules:

* The agent should be stored in a global **public static** variable named **ROOT\_AGENT** of type **BaseAgent** and initialized at declaration time.
* The agent definition has to be a **static** method so it can be loaded during the class initialization by the dynamic compiling classloader.

## **Run agent with Dev UI** {#run-agent-with-adk-web-server}

`Dev UI` is a web server where you can quickly run and test your agents for development purpose, without building your own UI application for the agents.

### **Define environment variables**

To run the server, you’ll need to export two environment variables:

* a Gemini key that you can [get from AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key),
* a variable to specify we’re not using Vertex AI this time.

```shell
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### **Run Dev UI**

Run the following command from the terminal to launch the Dev UI.

```console title="terminal"
mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
    -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java" \
    -Dexec.classpathScope="compile"
```

**Step 1:** Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8080` or
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`) directly in your browser.

**Step 2.** In the top-left corner of the UI, you can select your agent in
the dropdown. Select "science-app".

!!!note "Troubleshooting"

    If you do not see "science-app" in the dropdown menu, make sure you
    are running the `mvn` command at the location where your Java source code
    is located (usually `src/main/java`).

## Try Dev UI with text

With your favorite browser, navigate to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

You should see the following interface:

![Dev UI](../../assets/quickstart-streaming-devui.png)

Click the `Token Streaming` switch at the top right, and ask any questions for the science teacher such as `What's the electron?`. Then you should see the output text in streaming on the UI.

As we saw, you do not have to write any specific code in the agent itself for the text streaming capability. It is provided as an ADK Agent feature by default.

### Try with voice and video

To try with voice, reload the web browser, click the microphone button to enable the voice input, and ask the same question in voice. You will hear the answer in voice in real-time.

To try with video, reload the web browser, click the camera button to enable the video input, and ask questions like "What do you see?". The agent will answer what they see in the video input.

### Stop the tool

Stop the tool by pressing `Ctrl-C` on the console.

## **Run agent with a custom live audio app** {#run-agent-with-live-audio}

Now, let's try audio streaming with the agent and a custom live audio application.

### **A Maven pom.xml build file for Live Audio**

Replace your existing pom.xml with the following.

### **Creating Live Audio Run tool**

Create the **LiveAudioRun.java** file under the `src/main/java/` directory with the following content. This tool runs the agent on it with live audio input and output.

```java

package samples.liveaudio;

```

### **Run the Live Audio Run tool**

To run Live Audio Run tool, use the following command on the `adk-agents` directory:

```
mvn compile exec:java
```

Then you should see:

```
$ mvn compile exec:java
...
Initializing microphone input and speaker output...
Conversation started. Press Enter to stop...
Speaker initialized.
Microphone initialized. Start speaking...
```

With this message, the tool is ready to take voice input. Talk to the agent with a question like `What's the electron?`.

!!! Caution
    When you observe the agent keep speaking by itself and doesn't stop, try using earphones to suppress the echoing.

## **Summary** {#summary}

Streaming for ADK enables developers to create agents capable of low-latency, bidirectional voice and video communication, enhancing interactive experiences. The article demonstrates that text streaming is a built-in feature of ADK Agents, requiring no additional specific code, while also showcasing how to implement live audio conversations for real-time voice interaction with an agent. This allows for more natural and dynamic communication, as users can speak to and hear from the agent seamlessly.

================
File: docs/get-started/streaming/quickstart-streaming.md
================
# Build a streaming agent with Python

With this quickstart, you'll learn to create a simple agent and use ADK Streaming to enable voice and video communication with it that is low-latency and bidirectional. We will install ADK, set up a basic "Google Search" agent, try running the agent with Streaming with `adk web` tool, and then explain how to build a simple asynchronous web app by yourself using ADK Streaming and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

**Note:** This guide assumes you have experience using a terminal in Windows, Mac, and Linux environments.

## Supported models for voice/video streaming {#supported-models}

In order to use voice/video streaming in ADK, you will need to use Gemini models that support the Live API. You can find the **model ID(s)** that supports the Gemini Live API in the documentation:

- [Google AI Studio: Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#live-api)
- [Vertex AI: Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)

## 1. Setup Environment & Install ADK { #setup-environment-install-adk }

Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):

```bash
# Create
python -m venv .venv
# Activate (each new terminal)
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install ADK:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

## 2. Project Structure { #project-structure }

Create the following folder structure with empty files:

```console
adk-streaming/  # Project folder
└── app/ # the web app folder
    ├── .env # Gemini API key
    └── google_search_agent/ # Agent folder
        ├── __init__.py # Python package
        └── agent.py # Agent definition
```

### agent.py

Copy-paste the following code block into the `agent.py` file.

For `model`, please double check the model ID as described earlier in the [Models section](#supported-models).

```py
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search  # Import the tool

root_agent = Agent(
   # A unique name for the agent.
   name="basic_search_agent",
   # The Large Language Model (LLM) that agent will use.
   # Please fill in the latest model id that supports live from
   # https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/streaming/quickstart-streaming/#supported-models
   model="...",  # for example: model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-001" or model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09"
   # A short description of the agent's purpose.
   description="Agent to answer questions using Google Search.",
   # Instructions to set the agent's behavior.
   instruction="You are an expert researcher. You always stick to the facts.",
   # Add google_search tool to perform grounding with Google search.
   tools=[google_search]
)
```

`agent.py` is where all your agent(s)' logic will be stored, and you must have a `root_agent` defined.

Notice how easily you integrated [grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding?lang=python#configure-search) capabilities.  The `Agent` class and the `google_search` tool handle the complex interactions with the LLM and grounding with the search API, allowing you to focus on the agent's *purpose* and *behavior*.

![intro_components.png](../../assets/quickstart-streaming-tool.png)

Copy-paste the following code block to `__init__.py` file.

```py title="__init__.py"
from . import agent
```

## 3\. Set up the platform { #set-up-the-platform }

To run the agent, choose a platform from either Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI:

=== "Gemini - Google AI Studio"
    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2. Open the **`.env`** file located inside (`app/`) and copy-paste the following code.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

    3. Replace `PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual `API KEY`.

=== "Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI"
    1. You need an existing
       [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?e=48754805&hl=en) account and a
       project.
        * Set up a
          [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp)
        * Set up the
          [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
        * Authenticate to Google Cloud, from the terminal by running
          `gcloud auth login`.
        * [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).
    2. Open the **`.env`** file located inside (`app/`). Copy-paste
       the following code and update the project ID and location.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
        ```

## 4. Try the agent with `adk web` { #try-the-agent-with-adk-web }

Now it's ready to try the agent. Run the following command to launch the **dev UI**. First, make sure to set the current directory to `app`:

```shell
cd app
```

Also, set `SSL_CERT_FILE` variable with the following command. This is required for the voice and video tests later.

=== "OS X &amp; Linux"
    ```bash
    export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```powershell
    $env:SSL_CERT_FILE = (python -m certifi)
    ```



Then, run the dev UI:

```shell
adk web
```

!!!info "Note for Windows users"

    When hitting the `_make_subprocess_transport NotImplementedError`, consider using `adk web --no-reload` instead.


Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8000` or
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`) **directly in your browser**. This connection stays
entirely on your local machine. Select `google_search_agent`.

### Try with text

Try the following prompts by typing them in the UI.

* What is the weather in New York?
* What is the time in New York?
* What is the weather in Paris?
* What is the time in Paris?

The agent will use the google_search tool to get the latest information to answer those questions.

### Try with voice and video

To try with voice, reload the web browser, click the microphone button to enable the voice input, and ask the same question in voice. You will hear the answer in voice in real-time.

To try with video, reload the web browser, click the camera button to enable the video input, and ask questions like "What do you see?". The agent will answer what they see in the video input.

(Just clicking the microphone or camera button once is enough. Your voice or video will be streamed to models and the model response will be streamed back continuously. Clicking on the microphone or camera button multiple times is not supported.)

### Stop the tool

Stop `adk web` by pressing `Ctrl-C` on the console.

### Note on ADK Streaming

The following features will be supported in the future versions of the ADK Streaming: Callback, LongRunningTool, ExampleTool, and Shell agent (e.g. SequentialAgent).

Congratulations\! You've successfully created and interacted with your first Streaming agent using ADK\!

## Next steps: build custom streaming app

In [Custom Audio Streaming app](../../streaming/custom-streaming.md) tutorial, it overviews the server and client code for a custom asynchronous web app built with ADK Streaming and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), enabling real-time, bidirectional audio and text communication.

# Agent Development Kit (ADK)

<p style="text-align:center;"> <b> Build, Evaluate and Deploy agents, seamlessly! </b> </p>

ADK is designed to empower developers
to build, manage, evaluate and deploy AI-powered agents. It provides a robust
and flexible environment for creating both conversational and non-conversational
agents, capable of handling complex tasks and workflows.

![intro_components.png](../assets/adk-components.png)

## Core Concepts

ADK is built around a few key primitives and concepts that make it
powerful and flexible. Here are the essentials:

* **Agent:** The fundamental worker unit designed for specific tasks. Agents can
  use language models (`LlmAgent`) for complex reasoning, or act as deterministic controllers of the execution, which are called "[workflow agents](../agents/workflow-agents/index.md)" (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`).
* **Tool:** Gives agents abilities beyond conversation, letting them interact
  with external APIs, search information, run code, or call other services.
* **Callbacks:** Custom code snippets you provide to run at specific points in
  the agent's process, allowing for checks, logging, or behavior modifications.
* **Session Management (`Session` & `State`):** Handles the context of a single
  conversation (`Session`), including its history (`Events`) and the agent's
  working memory for that conversation (`State`).
* **Memory:** Enables agents to recall information about a user across
  *multiple* sessions, providing long-term context (distinct from short-term
  session `State`).
* **Artifact Management (`Artifact`):** Allows agents to save, load, and manage
  files or binary data (like images, PDFs) associated with a session or user.
* **Code Execution:** The ability for agents (usually via Tools) to generate and
  execute code to perform complex calculations or actions.
* **Planning:** An advanced capability where agents can break down complex goals
  into smaller steps and plan how to achieve them like a ReAct planner.
* **Models:** The underlying LLM that powers `LlmAgent`s, enabling their
  reasoning and language understanding abilities.
* **Event:** The basic unit of communication representing things that happen
  during a session (user message, agent reply, tool use), forming the
  conversation history.
* **Runner:** The engine that manages the execution flow, orchestrates agent
  interactions based on Events, and coordinates with backend services.

***Note:** Features like Multimodal Streaming, Evaluation, Deployment,
Debugging, and Trace are also part of the broader ADK ecosystem, supporting
real-time interaction and the development lifecycle.*

## Key Capabilities

ADK offers several key advantages for developers building
agentic applications:

1. **Multi-Agent System Design:** Easily build applications composed of
   multiple, specialized agents arranged hierarchically. Agents can coordinate
   complex tasks, delegate sub-tasks using LLM-driven transfer or explicit
   `AgentTool` invocation, enabling modular and scalable solutions.
2. **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Equip agents with diverse capabilities. ADK
   supports integrating custom functions (`FunctionTool`), using other agents as
   tools (`AgentTool`), leveraging built-in functionalities like code execution,
   and interacting with external data sources and APIs (e.g., Search,
   Databases). Support for long-running tools allows handling asynchronous
   operations effectively.
3. **Flexible Orchestration:** Define complex agent workflows using built-in
   workflow agents (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`) alongside
   LLM-driven dynamic routing. This allows for both predictable pipelines and
   adaptive agent behavior.
4. **Integrated Developer Tooling:** Develop and iterate locally with ease.
   ADK includes tools like a command-line interface (CLI) and a Developer
   UI for running agents, inspecting execution steps (events, state changes),
   debugging interactions, and visualizing agent definitions.
5. **Native Streaming Support:** Build real-time, interactive experiences with
   native support for bidirectional streaming (text and audio). This integrates
   seamlessly with underlying capabilities like the
   [Multimodal Live API for the Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live)
   (or for
   [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/multimodal-live)),
   often enabled with simple configuration changes.
6. **Built-in Agent Evaluation:** Assess agent performance systematically. The
   framework includes tools to create multi-turn evaluation datasets and run
   evaluations locally (via CLI or the dev UI) to measure quality and
   guide improvements.
7. **Broad LLM Support:** While optimized for Google's Gemini models, the
   framework is designed for flexibility, allowing integration with various LLMs
   (potentially including open-source or fine-tuned models) through its
   `BaseLlm` interface.
8. **Artifact Management:** Enable agents to handle files and binary data. The
   framework provides mechanisms (`ArtifactService`, context methods) for agents
   to save, load, and manage versioned artifacts like images, documents, or
   generated reports during their execution.
9. **Extensibility and Interoperability:** ADK promotes an open
   ecosystem. While providing core tools, it allows developers to easily
   integrate and reuse tools from other popular agent frameworks including
   LangChain and CrewAI.
10. **State and Memory Management:** Automatically handles short-term
    conversational memory (`State` within a `Session`) managed by the
    `SessionService`. Provides integration points for longer-term `Memory`
    services, allowing agents to recall user information across multiple
    sessions.

# Installing ADK

=== "Python"

    ## Create & activate virtual environment
    
    We recommend creating a virtual Python environment using
    [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
    
    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    
    Now, you can activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for
    your operating system and environment:
    
    ```
    # Mac / Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Windows CMD:
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    
    # Windows PowerShell:
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    ### Install ADK
    
    ```bash
    pip install google-adk
    ```
    
    (Optional) Verify your installation:
    
    ```bash
    pip show google-adk
    ```

=== "Java"

    You can either use maven or gradle to add the `google-adk` and `google-adk-dev` package.

    `google-adk` is the core Java ADK library. Java ADK also comes with a pluggable example SpringBoot server to run your agents seamlessly. This optional
    package is present as part of `google-adk-dev`.
    
    If you are using maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml title="pom.xml"
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

        <groupId>com.example.agent</groupId>
        <artifactId>adk-agents</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

            <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        </properties>

        <dependencies>
            <!-- The ADK core dependency -->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
                <artifactId>google-adk</artifactId>
                <version>0.3.0</version>
            </dependency>
            <!-- The ADK dev web UI to debug your agent -->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
                <artifactId>google-adk-dev</artifactId>
                <version>0.3.0</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>

    </project>
    ```

    Here's a [complete pom.xml](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/java/cloud-run/pom.xml) file for reference.

    If you are using gradle, add the dependency to your build.gradle:

    ```title="build.gradle"
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.google.adk:google-adk:0.2.0'
        implementation 'com.google.adk:google-adk-dev:0.2.0'
    }
    ```

    You should also configure Gradle to pass `-parameters` to `javac`. (Alternatively, use `@Schema(name = "...")`).


## Next steps

* Try creating your first agent with the [**Quickstart**](quickstart.md)

================
File: docs/get-started/java.md
================
# Java Quickstart for ADK

This guide shows you how to get up and running with Agent Development Kit
for Java. Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

*   Java 17 or later
*   Maven 3.9 or later

## Create an agent project

Create an agent project with the following files and directory structure:

```none
my_agent/
    src/main/java/com/example/agent/
                        HelloTimeAgent.java # main agent code
                        AgentCliRunner.java # command-line interface
    pom.xml                                 # project configuration
    .env                                    # API keys or project IDs
```

??? tip "Create this project structure using the command line"

    === "Windows"

        ```console
        mkdir my_agent\src\main\java\com\example\agent
        type nul > my_agent\src\main\java\com\example\agent\HelloTimeAgent.java
        type nul > my_agent\src\main\java\com\example\agent\AgentCliRunner.java
        type nul > my_agent\pom.xml
        type nul > my_agent\.env
        ```

    === "MacOS / Linux"

        ```bash
        mkdir -p my_agent/src/main/java/com/example/agent && \
            touch my_agent/src/main/java/com/example/agent/HelloTimeAgent.java \
            touch my_agent/src/main/java/com/example/agent/AgentCliRunner.java \
            touch my_agent/pom.xml my_agent/.env
        ```

### Define the agent code

Create the code for a basic agent, including a simple implementation of an ADK 
[Function Tool](/adk-docs/tools/function-tools/), called `getCurrentTime()`.
Add the following code to the `HelloTimeAgent.java` file in your project
directory: 

```java title="my_agent/src/main/java/com/example/agent/HelloTimeAgent.java"
package com.example.agent;

import com.google.adk.agents.BaseAgent;
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.tools.Annotations.Schema;
import com.google.adk.tools.FunctionTool;

import java.util.Map;

public class HelloTimeAgent {

    public static BaseAgent ROOT_AGENT = initAgent();

    private static BaseAgent initAgent() {
        return LlmAgent.builder()
            .name("hello-time-agent")
            .description("Tells the current time in a specified city")
            .instruction("""
                You are a helpful assistant that tells the current time in a city.                
                Use the 'getCurrentTime' tool for this purpose.
                """)
            .model("gemini-2.5-flash")
            .tools(FunctionTool.create(HelloTimeAgent.class, "getCurrentTime"))
            .build();
    }

    /** Mock tool implementation */
    @Schema(description = "Get the current time for a given city")
    public static Map<String, String> getCurrentTime(
        @Schema(name = "city", description = "Name of the city to get the time for") String city) {
        return Map.of(
            "city", city,
            "forecast", "The time is 10:30am."
        );
    }
}
```

### Configure project and dependencies

An ADK agent project requires this dependency in your
`pom.xml` project file:

```xml title="my_agent/pom.xml (partial)"
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
        <artifactId>adk-core</artifactId>
        <version>0.3.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Update the `pom.xml` project file to include this dependency and
addtional settings with the following configuration code:

??? info "Complete `pom.xml` configuration for project"
    The following code shows a complete `pom.xml` configuration for
    this project:

    ```xml title="my_agent/pom.xml"

            </dependency>
        </dependencies>

    </project>
    ```

### Set your API key

This project uses the Gemini API, which requires an API key. If you
don't already have Gemini API key, create a key in Google AI Studio on the 
[API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) page.

In a terminal window, write your API key into your `.env` file of your project
to set environment variables:

=== "MacOS / Linux"

    ```bash title="Update: my_agent/.env"
    echo 'export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```console title="Update: my_agent/.env"
    echo 'set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > env.bat
    ```

??? tip "Using other AI models with ADK"
    ADK supports the use of many generative AI models. For more
    information on configuring other models in ADK agents, see
    [Models & Authentication](/adk-docs/agents/models).

### Create an agent command-line interface

Create a `AgentCliRunner.java` class to allow you to run and interact with
`HelloTimeAgent` from the command line. This code shows how to create a
`RunConfig` object to run the agent and a `Session` object to interact with the
running agent.

```java title="my_agent/src/main/java/com/example/agent/AgentCliRunner.java"
package com.example.agent;

import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig;
import com.google.adk.events.Event;
import com.google.adk.runner.InMemoryRunner;
import com.google.adk.sessions.Session;
import com.google.genai.types.Content;
import com.google.genai.types.Part;
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Flowable;
import java.util.Scanner;

import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;

public class AgentCliRunner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RunConfig runConfig = RunConfig.builder().build();
        InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(HelloTimeAgent.ROOT_AGENT);

        Session session = runner
                .sessionService()
                .createSession(runner.appName(), "user1234")
                .blockingGet();

        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in, UTF_8)) {
            while (true) {
                System.out.print("\nYou > ");
                String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
                if ("quit".equalsIgnoreCase(userInput)) {
                    break;
                }

                Content userMsg = Content.fromParts(Part.fromText(userInput));
                Flowable<Event> events = runner.runAsync(session.userId(), session.id(), userMsg, runConfig);

                System.out.print("\nAgent > ");
                events.blockingForEach(event -> {
                    if (event.finalResponse()) {
                        System.out.println(event.stringifyContent());
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Run your agent

You can run your ADK agent using the interactive command-line interface
`AgentCliRunner` class you defined or the ADK web user interface provided by
the ADK using the `AdkWebServer` class. Both these options allow you to test and
interact with your agent.

### Run with command-line interface

Run your agent with the command-line interface `AgentCliRunner` class
using the following Maven command:

```console
# Remember to load keys and settings: source .env OR env.bat
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.agent.AgentCliRunner"
```

![adk-run.png](/adk-docs/assets/adk-run.png)

### Run with web interface

Run your agent with the ADK web interface using the following Maven command:

```console
# Remember to load keys and settings: source .env OR env.bat
mvn compile exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
    -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=target --server.port=8000"
```

This command starts a web server with a chat interface for your agent. You can
access the web interface at (http://localhost:8000). Select your agent at the
upper right corner and type a request.

![adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png](/adk-docs/assets/adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png)

## Next: Build your agent

Now that you have ADK installed and your first agent running, try building
your own agent with our build guides:

*  [Build your agent](/adk-docs/tutorials/)

File: docs/get-started/python.md
================
# Python Quickstart for ADK

This guide shows you how to get up and running with Agent Development Kit
(ADK) for Python. Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.9 or later
*   `pip` for installing packages   

## Installation

Install ADK by running the following command:

```shell
pip install google-adk
```

??? tip "Recommended: create and activate a Python virtual environment"

    Create a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    Activate the Python virtual environment:

    === "Windows CMD"

        ```console
        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```

    === "Windows Powershell"

        ```console
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

    === "MacOS / Linux"

        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

## Create an agent project

Run the `adk create` command to start a new agent project. 

```shell
adk create my_agent
```

### Explore the agent project

The created agent project has the following structure, with the `agent.py`
file containing the main control code for the agent.

```none
my_agent/
    agent.py      # main agent code
    .env          # API keys or project IDs
    __init__.py
```

## Update your agent project

The `agent.py` file contains a `root_agent` definition which is the only
required element of an ADK agent. You can also define tools for the agent to
use. Update the generated `agent.py` code to include a `get_current_time` tool
for use by the agent, as shown in the following code:

```python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent

# Mock tool implementation
def get_current_time(city: str) -> dict:
    """Returns the current time in a specified city."""
    return {"status": "success", "city": city, "time": "10:30 AM"}

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.5-flash',
    name='root_agent',
    description="Tells the current time in a specified city.",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant that tells the current time in cities. Use the 'get_current_time' tool for this purpose.",
    tools=[get_current_time],
)
```

### Set your API key

This project uses the Gemini API, which requires an API key. If you
don't already have Gemini API key, create a key in Google AI Studio on the 
[API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) page.

In a terminal window, write your API key into an `.env` file as an environment variable:

```console title="Update: my_agent/.env"
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
```

??? tip "Using other AI models with ADK"
    ADK supports the use of many generative AI models. For more
    information on configuring other models in ADK agents, see
    [Models & Authentication](/adk-docs/agents/models).

## Run your agent

You can run your ADK agent with an interactive command-line interface using the
`adk run` command or the ADK web user interface provided by the ADK using the
`adk web` command. Both these options allow you to test and interact with your
agent.

### Run with command-line interface

Run your agent using the `adk run` command-line tool.

```console
adk run my_agent
```

![adk-run.png](/adk-docs/assets/adk-run.png)

### Run with web interface

The ADK framework provides web interface you can use to test and interact with
your agent. You can start the web interface using the following command:

```console
adk web --port 8000 my_agent
```

This command starts a web server with a chat interface for your agent. You can
access the web interface at (http://localhost:8000). Select the agent at the
upper right corner and type a request.

![adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png](/adk-docs/assets/adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png)

## Next: Build your agent

Now that you have ADK installed and your first agent running, try building
your own agent with our build guides:

*  [Build your agent](/adk-docs/tutorials/)

# Build a multi-tool agent

This quickstart guides you through installing the Agent Development Kit (ADK),
setting up a basic agent with multiple tools, and running it locally either in the terminal or in the interactive, browser-based dev UI.

<!-- <img src="../../assets/quickstart.png" alt="Quickstart setup"> -->

This quickstart assumes a local IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
with Python 3.9+ or Java 17+ and terminal access. This method runs the
application entirely on your machine and is recommended for internal development.

## 1. Set up Environment & Install ADK { #set-up-environment-install-adk }

=== "Python"

    Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):

    ```bash
    # Create
    python -m venv .venv
    # Activate (each new terminal)
    # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
    # Windows CMD: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    Install ADK:

    ```bash
    pip install google-adk
    ```

=== "Java"

    To install ADK and setup the environment, proceed to the following steps.

## 2. Create Agent Project { #create-agent-project }

### Project structure

=== "Python"

    You will need to create the following project structure:

    ```console
    parent_folder/
        multi_tool_agent/
            __init__.py
            agent.py
            .env
    ```

    Create the folder `multi_tool_agent`:

    ```bash
    mkdir multi_tool_agent/
    ```

    !!! info "Note for Windows users"

        When using ADK on Windows for the next few steps, we recommend creating
        Python files using File Explorer or an IDE because the following commands
        (`mkdir`, `echo`) typically generate files with null bytes and/or incorrect
        encoding.

    ### `__init__.py`

    Now create an `__init__.py` file in the folder:

    ```shell
    echo "from . import agent" > multi_tool_agent/__init__.py
    ```

    Your `__init__.py` should now look like this:

    ```python title="multi_tool_agent/__init__.py"
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent/__init__.py"
    ```

    ### `agent.py`

    Create an `agent.py` file in the same folder:

    === "OS X &amp; Linux"
        ```shell
        touch multi_tool_agent/agent.py
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ```shell
        type nul > multi_tool_agent/agent.py
        ```

    Copy and paste the following code into `agent.py`:

    ```python title="multi_tool_agent/agent.py"
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent/agent.py"
    ```

    ### `.env`

    Create a `.env` file in the same folder:

    === "OS X &amp; Linux"
        ```shell
        touch multi_tool_agent/.env
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ```shell
        type nul > multi_tool_agent\.env
        ```

    More instructions about this file are described in the next section on [Set up the model](#set-up-the-model).

=== "Java"

    Java projects generally feature the following project structure:

    ```console
    project_folder/
    ├── pom.xml (or build.gradle)
    ├── src/
    ├── └── main/
    │       └── java/
    │           └── agents/
    │               └── multitool/
    └── test/
    ```

    ### Create `MultiToolAgent.java`

    Create a `MultiToolAgent.java` source file in the `agents.multitool` package
    in the `src/main/java/agents/multitool/` directory.

    Copy and paste the following code into `MultiToolAgent.java`:

    ```java title="agents/multitool/MultiToolAgent.java"
    --8<-- "examples/java/cloud-run/src/main/java/agents/multitool/MultiToolAgent.java:full_code"
    ```

## 3. Set up the model { #set-up-the-model }

Your agent's ability to understand user requests and generate responses is
powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Your agent needs to make secure calls
to this external LLM service, which **requires authentication credentials**. Without
valid authentication, the LLM service will deny the agent's requests, and the
agent will be unable to function.

!!!tip "Model Authentication guide"
    For a detailed guide on authenticating to different models, see the [Authentication guide](../agents/models.md#google-ai-studio).
    This is a critical step to ensure your agent can make calls to the LLM service.

=== "Gemini - Google AI Studio"
    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2. When using Python, open the **`.env`** file located inside (`multi_tool_agent/`)
    and copy-paste the following code.

        ```env title="multi_tool_agent/.env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

        When using Java, define environment variables:

        ```console title="terminal"
        export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

    3. Replace `PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual `API KEY`.

=== "Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI"
    1. Set up a [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp) and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

        export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
        export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=LOCATION
        ```

=== "Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI with Express Mode"
    1. You can sign up for a free Google Cloud project and use Gemini for free with an eligible account!
        * Set up a
          [Google Cloud project with Vertex AI Express Mode](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview)
        * Get an API key from your Express mode project. This key can be used with ADK to use Gemini models for free, as well as access to Agent Engine services.
    2. When using Python, open the **`.env`** file located inside (`multi_tool_agent/`). Copy-paste
    the following code and update the project ID and location.

        export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_EXPRESS_MODE_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

## 4. Run Your Agent { #run-your-agent }

=== "Python"

    Using the terminal, navigate to the parent directory of your agent project
    (e.g. using `cd ..`):

    ```console
    parent_folder/      <-- navigate to this directory
        multi_tool_agent/
            __init__.py
            agent.py
            .env
    ```

    There are multiple ways to interact with your agent:

    === "Dev UI (adk web)"

        !!! success "Authentication Setup for Vertex AI Users"
            If you selected **"Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI"** in the previous step, you must authenticate with Google Cloud before launching the dev UI.
            
            Run this command and follow the prompts:
            ```bash
            gcloud auth application-default login
            ```
            
            **Note:** Skip this step if you're using "Gemini - Google AI Studio".

        Run the following command to launch the **dev UI**.

        ```shell
        adk web
        ```
        
        !!!info "Note for Windows users"

            When hitting the `_make_subprocess_transport NotImplementedError`, consider using `adk web --no-reload` instead.


        **Step 1:** Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8000` or
        `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) directly in your browser.

        **Step 2.** In the top-left corner of the UI, you can select your agent in
        the dropdown. Select "multi_tool_agent".

        !!!note "Troubleshooting"

            If you do not see "multi_tool_agent" in the dropdown menu, make sure you
            are running `adk web` in the **parent folder** of your agent folder
            (i.e. the parent folder of multi_tool_agent).

        **Step 3.** Now you can chat with your agent using the textbox:

        ![adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png](../assets/adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png)


        **Step 4.**  By using the `Events` tab at the left, you can inspect
        individual function calls, responses and model responses by clicking on the
        actions:

        ![adk-web-dev-ui-function-call.png](../assets/adk-web-dev-ui-function-call.png)

        On the `Events` tab, you can also click the `Trace` button to see the trace logs for each event that shows the latency of each function calls:

        ![adk-web-dev-ui-trace.png](../assets/adk-web-dev-ui-trace.png)

        **Step 5.** You can also enable your microphone and talk to your agent:

        !!!note "Model support for voice/video streaming"

            In order to use voice/video streaming in ADK, you will need to use Gemini models that support the Live API. You can find the **model ID(s)** that supports the Gemini Live API in the documentation:

            - [Google AI Studio: Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#live-api)
            - [Vertex AI: Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)

            You can then replace the `model` string in `root_agent` in the `agent.py` file you created earlier ([jump to section](#agentpy)). Your code should look something like:

            ```py
            root_agent = Agent(
                name="weather_time_agent",
                model="replace-me-with-model-id", #e.g. gemini-2.0-flash-live-001
                ...
            ```

        ![adk-web-dev-ui-audio.png](../assets/adk-web-dev-ui-audio.png)

    === "Terminal (adk run)"

        !!! tip

            When using `adk run` you can inject prompts into the agent to start by
            piping text to the command like so:

            ```shell
            echo "Please start by listing files" | adk run file_listing_agent
            ```
            
        Run the following command, to chat with your Weather agent.

        ```
        adk run multi_tool_agent
        ```

        ![adk-run.png](../assets/adk-run.png)

        To exit, use Cmd/Ctrl+C.

    === "API Server (adk api_server)"

        `adk api_server` enables you to create a local FastAPI server in a single
        command, enabling you to test local cURL requests before you deploy your
        agent.

        ![adk-api-server.png](../assets/adk-api-server.png)

        To learn how to use `adk api_server` for testing, refer to the
        [documentation on testing](testing.md).

=== "Java"

    Using the terminal, navigate to the parent directory of your agent project
    (e.g. using `cd ..`):

    ```console
    project_folder/                <-- navigate to this directory
    ├── pom.xml (or build.gradle)
    ├── src/
    ├── └── main/
    │       └── java/
    │           └── agents/
    │               └── multitool/
    │                   └── MultiToolAgent.java
    └── test/
    ```

    === "Dev UI"

        Run the following command from the terminal to launch the Dev UI.

        **DO NOT change the main class name of the Dev UI server.**

        ```console title="terminal"
        mvn exec:java \
            -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
            -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java" \
            -Dexec.classpathScope="compile"
        ```

        **Step 1:** Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8080` or
        `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) directly in your browser.

        **Step 2.** In the top-left corner of the UI, you can select your agent in
        the dropdown. Select "multi_tool_agent".

        !!!note "Troubleshooting"

            If you do not see "multi_tool_agent" in the dropdown menu, make sure you
            are running the `mvn` command at the location where your Java source code
            is located (usually `src/main/java`).

        **Step 3.** Now you can chat with your agent using the textbox:

        ![adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png](../assets/adk-web-dev-ui-chat.png)

        **Step 4.** You can also inspect individual function calls, responses and
        model responses by clicking on the actions:

        ![adk-web-dev-ui-function-call.png](../assets/adk-web-dev-ui-function-call.png)

    === "Maven"

        With Maven, run the `main()` method of your Java class
        with the following command:

        ```console title="terminal"
        mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="agents.multitool.MultiToolAgent"
        ```

    === "Gradle"

        With Gradle, the `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` build file
        should have the following Java plugin in its `plugins` section:

        ```groovy
        plugins {
            id('java')
            // other plugins
        }
        ```

        Then, elsewhere in the build file, at the top-level,
        create a new task to run the `main()` method of your agent:

        ```groovy
        tasks.register('runAgent', JavaExec) {
            classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
            mainClass = 'agents.multitool.MultiToolAgent'
        }
        ```

        Finally, on the command-line, run the following command:

        ```console
        gradle runAgent
        ```

# Testing your Agents

Before you deploy your agent, you should test it to ensure that it is working as
intended. The easiest way to test your agent in your development environment is
to use the ADK API server.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    adk api_server
    ```

=== "Java"

    Make sure to update the port number.
    === "Maven"
        With Maven, compile and run the ADK web server:
        ```console
        mvn compile exec:java \
         -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java/agents --server.port=8080"
        ```
    === "Gradle"
        With Gradle, the `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` build file should have the following Java plugin in its plugins section:

        ```groovy
        plugins {
            id('java')
            // other plugins
        }
        ```
        Then, elsewhere in the build file, at the top-level, create a new task:

        ```groovy
        tasks.register('runADKWebServer', JavaExec) {
            dependsOn classes 
            classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
            mainClass = 'com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer'
            args '--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java/agents', '--server.port=8080'
        }
        ```

        Finally, on the command-line, run the following command:
        ```console
        gradle runADKWebServer
        ```

    
    In Java, both the Dev UI and the API server are bundled together.

This command will launch a local web server, where you can run cURL commands or send API requests to test your agent.

!!! tip "Advanced Usage and Debugging"

    For a complete reference on all available endpoints, request/response formats, and tips for debugging (including how to use the interactive API documentation), see the **ADK API Server Guide** below.

## Local testing

Local testing involves launching a local web server, creating a session, and
sending queries to your agent. First, ensure you are in the correct working
directory:

```console
parent_folder/
└── my_sample_agent/
    └── agent.py (or Agent.java)
```

**Launch the Local Server**

Next, launch the local server using the commands listed above.

The output should appear similar to:

=== "Python"

    ```shell
    INFO:     Started server process [12345]
    INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    INFO:     Application startup complete.
    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```shell
    2025-05-13T23:32:08.972-06:00  INFO 37864 --- [ebServer.main()] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/'
    2025-05-13T23:32:08.980-06:00  INFO 37864 --- [ebServer.main()] com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer          : Started AdkWebServer in 1.15 seconds (process running for 2.877)
    2025-05-13T23:32:08.981-06:00  INFO 37864 --- [ebServer.main()] com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer          : AdkWebServer application started successfully.
    ```

Your server is now running locally. Ensure you use the correct **_port number_** in all the subsequent commands.

**Create a new session**

With the API server still running, open a new terminal window or tab and create
a new session with the agent using:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}}'
```

Let's break down what's happening:

* `http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_123`: This
  creates a new session for your agent `my_sample_agent`, which is the name of
  the agent folder, for a user ID (`u_123`) and for a session ID (`s_123`). You
  can replace `my_sample_agent` with the name of your agent folder. You can
  replace `u_123` with a specific user ID, and `s_123` with a specific session
  ID.
* `{"state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}}`: This is optional. You can use
  this to customize the agent's pre-existing state (dict) when creating the
  session.

This should return the session information if it was created successfully. The
output should appear similar to:

```json
{"id":"s_123","appName":"my_sample_agent","userId":"u_123","state":{"key1":"value1","key2":42},"events":[],"lastUpdateTime":1743711430.022186}
```

!!! info

    You cannot create multiple sessions with exactly the same user ID and
    session ID. If you try to, you may see a response, like:
    `{"detail":"Session already exists: s_123"}`. To fix this, you can either
    delete that session (e.g., `s_123`), or choose a different session ID.

**Send a query**

There are two ways to send queries via POST to your agent, via the `/run` or
`/run_sse` routes.

* `POST http://localhost:8000/run`: collects all events as a list and returns the
  list all at once. Suitable for most users (if you are unsure, we recommend
  using this one).
* `POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse`: returns as Server-Sent-Events, which is a
  stream of event objects. Suitable for those who want to be notified as soon as
  the event is available. With `/run_sse`, you can also set `streaming` to
  `true` to enable token-level streaming.

**Using `/run`**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"app_name": "my_sample_agent",
"user_id": "u_123",
"session_id": "s_123",
"new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{
    "text": "Hey whats the weather in new york today"
    }]
}
}'
```

If using `/run`, you will see the full output of events at the same time, as a
list, which should appear similar to:

```json
[{"content":{"parts":[{"functionCall":{"id":"af-e75e946d-c02a-4aad-931e-49e4ab859838","args":{"city":"new york"},"name":"get_weather"}}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"longRunningToolIds":[],"id":"2Btee6zW","timestamp":1743712220.385936},{"content":{"parts":[{"functionResponse":{"id":"af-e75e946d-c02a-4aad-931e-49e4ab859838","name":"get_weather","response":{"status":"success","report":"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit)."}}}],"role":"user"},"invocationId":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"PmWibL2m","timestamp":1743712221.895042},{"content":{"parts":[{"text":"OK. The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).\n"}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"sYT42eVC","timestamp":1743712221.899018}]
```

**Using `/run_sse`**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"app_name": "my_sample_agent",
"user_id": "u_123",
"session_id": "s_123",
"new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{
    "text": "Hey whats the weather in new york today"
    }]
},
"streaming": false
}'
```

You can set `streaming` to `true` to enable token-level streaming, which means
the response will be returned to you in multiple chunks and the output should
appear similar to:


```shell
data: {"content":{"parts":[{"functionCall":{"id":"af-f83f8af9-f732-46b6-8cb5-7b5b73bbf13d","args":{"city":"new york"},"name":"get_weather"}}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"longRunningToolIds":[],"id":"ptcjaZBa","timestamp":1743712255.313043}

data: {"content":{"parts":[{"functionResponse":{"id":"af-f83f8af9-f732-46b6-8cb5-7b5b73bbf13d","name":"get_weather","response":{"status":"success","report":"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit)."}}}],"role":"user"},"invocationId":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"5aocxjaq","timestamp":1743712257.387306}

data: {"content":{"parts":[{"text":"OK.

```
**Send a query with a base64 encoded file using `/run` or `/run_sse`**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
--H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--d '{
   "appName":"my_sample_agent",
   "userId":"u_123",
   "sessionId":"s_123",

         }
      ]
   },
   "streaming":false
}'
```

!!! info

    If you are using `/run_sse`, you should see each event as soon as it becomes
    available.

## Integrations

ADK uses [Callbacks](../callbacks/index.md) to integrate with third-party
observability tools. These integrations capture detailed traces of agent calls
and interactions, which are crucial for understanding behavior, debugging
issues, and evaluating performance.

* [Comet Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) is an open-source LLM
  observability and evaluation platform that
  [natively supports ADK](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/integrations/adk).

## Deploying your agent

Now that you've verified the local operation of your agent, you're ready to move
on to deploying your agent! Here are some ways you can deploy your agent:

* Deploy to [Agent Engine](../deploy/agent-engine.md), the easiest way to deploy
  your ADK agents to a managed service in Vertex AI on Google Cloud.
* Deploy to [Cloud Run](../deploy/cloud-run.md) and have full control over how
  you scale and manage your agents using serverless architecture on Google
  Cloud.


## The ADK API Server

The ADK API Server is a pre-packaged [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web server that exposes your agents through a RESTful API. It is the primary tool for local testing and development, allowing you to interact with your agents programmatically before deploying them.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command from your project's root directory:

```shell
adk api_server
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:8000`. You will see output confirming that the server has started:

```shell
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Debugging with Interactive API Docs

The API server automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI. This is an invaluable tool for exploring endpoints, understanding request formats, and testing your agent directly from your browser.

To access the interactive docs, start the API server and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your web browser.

You will see a complete, interactive list of all available API endpoints, which you can expand to see detailed information about parameters, request bodies, and response schemas. You can even click "Try it out" to send live requests to your running agents.

## API Endpoints

The following sections detail the primary endpoints for interacting with your agents.

!!! note "JSON Naming Convention"
    - **Request bodies** must use `snake_case` for field names (e.g., `"app_name"`).
    - **Response bodies** will use `camelCase` for field names (e.g., `"appName"`).

### Utility Endpoints

#### List Available Agents

Returns a list of all agent applications discovered by the server.

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/list-apps`

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/list-apps
```

**Example Response**
```json
["my_sample_agent", "another_agent"]
```

---

### Session Management

Sessions store the state and event history for a specific user's interaction with an agent.

#### Create or Update a Session

Creates a new session or updates an existing one. If a session with the given IDs already exists, its state will be overwritten with the new state provided.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Path:** `/apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}`

**Request Body**
```json
{
  "state": {

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_abc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state": {"visit_count": 5}}'
```

**Example Response**
```json
{"id":"s_abc","appName":"my_sample_agent","userId":"u_123","state":{"visit_count":5},"events":[],"lastUpdateTime":1743711430.022186}
```

#### Get a Session

Retrieves the details of a specific session, including its current state and all associated events.

*   **Method:** `GET`

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_abc
```

**Example Response**
```json
{"id":"s_abc","appName":"my_sample_agent","userId":"u_123","state":{"visit_count":5},"events":[...],"lastUpdateTime":1743711430.022186}
```

#### Delete a Session

Deletes a session and all of its associated data.

*   **Method:** `DELETE`
*   **Path:** `/apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}`

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_abc
```

**Example Response**
A successful deletion returns an empty response with a `204 No Content` status code.

---

### Agent Execution

These endpoints are used to send a new message to an agent and get a response.

#### Run Agent (Single Response)

Executes the agent and returns all generated events in a single JSON array after the run is complete.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Path:** `/run`

# Understanding Google Search Grounding

[Google Search Grounding tool](../tools/built-in-tools.md#google-search) is a powerful feature in the Agent Development Kit (ADK) that enables AI agents to access real-time, authoritative information from the web. By connecting your agents to Google Search, you can provide users with up-to-date answers backed by reliable sources.

This feature is particularly valuable for queries requiring current information like weather updates, news events, stock prices, or any facts that may have changed since the model's training data cutoff. When your agent determines that external information is needed, it automatically performs web searches and incorporates the results into its response with proper attribution.

## What You'll Learn

In this guide, you'll discover:

- **Quick Setup**: How to create and run a Google Search-enabled agent from scratch
- **Grounding Architecture**: The data flow and technical process behind web grounding
- **Response Structure**: How to interpret grounded responses and their metadata
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for displaying search results and citations to users

### Additional resource

As an additional resource, [Gemini Fullstack Agent Development Kit (ADK) Quickstart](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/gemini-fullstack) has [a great practical use of the Google Search grounding](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/main/python/agents/gemini-fullstack/app/agent.py) as a full stack application example.

## Google Search Grounding Quickstart

This quickstart guides you through creating an ADK agent with Google Search grounding feature. This quickstart assumes a local IDE (VS Code or PyCharm, etc.) with Python 3.9+ and terminal access.

### 1. Set up Environment & Install ADK { #set-up-environment-install-adk }

Create & Activate Virtual Environment:

```bash
# Create
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (each new terminal)
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install ADK:

```bash
pip install google-adk==1.4.2
```

### 2. Create Agent Project { #create-agent-project }

Under a project directory, run the following commands:

=== "OS X &amp; Linux"
    ```bash
    # Step 1: Create a new directory for your agent
    mkdir google_search_agent

    # Step 2: Create __init__.py for the agent
    echo "from . import agent" > google_search_agent/__init__.py

    # Step 3: Create an agent.py (the agent definition) and .env (Gemini authentication config)
    touch google_search_agent/agent.py .env
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```shell
    # Step 1: Create a new directory for your agent
    mkdir google_search_agent

    # Step 2: Create __init__.py for the agent
    echo "from . import agent" > google_search_agent/__init__.py

    # Step 3: Create an agent.py (the agent definition) and .env (Gemini authentication config)
    type nul > google_search_agent\agent.py 
    type nul > google_search_agent\.env
    ```



#### Edit `agent.py`

Copy and paste the following code into `agent.py`:

```python title="google_search_agent/agent.py"
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="google_search_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="Answer questions using Google Search when needed. Always cite sources.",
    description="Professional search assistant with Google Search capabilities",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

Now you would have the following directory structure:

```console
my_project/
    google_search_agent/
        __init__.py
        agent.py
    .env
```

### 3. Choose a platform { #choose-a-platform }

To run the agent, you need to select a platform that the agent will use for calling the Gemini model. Choose one from Google AI Studio or Vertex AI:

=== "Gemini - Google AI Studio"
    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2. When using Python, open the **`.env`** file and copy-paste the following code.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

    3. Replace `PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual `API KEY`.

=== "Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI"
    1. You need an existing
    [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?e=48754805&hl=en) account and a
    project.
        * Set up a
          [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp)
        * Set up the
          [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
        * Authenticate to Google Cloud, from the terminal by running
          `gcloud auth login`.
        * [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).
    2. When using Python, open the **`.env`** file and copy-paste the following code and update the project ID and location.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=LOCATION
        ```

### 4. Run Your Agent { #run-your-agent }

There are multiple ways to interact with your agent:

=== "Dev UI (adk web)"
    Run the following command to launch the **dev UI**.

    ```shell
    adk web
    ```
    
    !!!info "Note for Windows users"

        When hitting the `_make_subprocess_transport NotImplementedError`, consider using `adk web --no-reload` instead.


    **Step 1:** Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8000` or
    `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) directly in your browser.

    **Step 2.** In the top-left corner of the UI, you can select your agent in
    the dropdown. Select "google_search_agent".

    !!!note "Troubleshooting"

        If you do not see "google_search_agent" in the dropdown menu, make sure you
        are running `adk web` in the **parent folder** of your agent folder
        (i.e. the parent folder of google_search_agent).

    **Step 3.** Now you can chat with your agent using the textbox.

=== "Terminal (adk run)"

    Run the following command, to chat with your Weather agent.

    ```
    adk run google_search_agent
    ```
    To exit, use Cmd/Ctrl+C.

### 📝 Example prompts to try

With those questions, you can confirm that the agent is actually calling Google Search
to get the latest weather and time.

* What is the weather in New York?
* What is the time in New York?
* What is the weather in Paris?
* What is the time in Paris?

![Try the agent with adk web](../assets/google_search_grd_adk_web.png)

You've successfully created and interacted with your Google Search agent using ADK!

## How grounding with Google Search works

Grounding is the process that connects your agent to real-time information from the web, allowing it to generate more accurate and current responses. When a user's prompt requires information that the model was not trained on, or that is time-sensitive, the agent's underlying Large Language Model intelligently decides to invoke the google\_search tool to find the relevant facts

### **Data Flow Diagram**

This diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of how a user query results in a grounded response.

![](../assets/google_search_grd_dataflow.png)

### **Detailed Description**

The grounding agent uses the data flow described in the diagram to retrieve, process, and incorporate external information into the final answer presented to the user.

1. **User Query**: An end-user interacts with your agent by asking a question or giving a command.  
2. **ADK Orchestration** : The Agent Development Kit orchestrates the agent's behavior and passes the user's message to the core of your agent.  
3. **LLM Analysis and Tool-Calling** : The agent's LLM (e.g., a Gemini model) analyzes the prompt. If it determines that external, up-to-date information is required, it triggers the grounding mechanism by calling the  
    google\_search tool. This is ideal for answering queries about recent news, weather, or facts not present in the model's training data.  
4. **Grounding Service Interaction** : The google\_search tool interacts with an internal grounding service that formulates and sends one or more queries to the Google Search Index.  
5. **Context Injection**: The grounding service retrieves the relevant web pages and snippets. It then integrates these search results into the model's context  
    before the final response is generated. This crucial step allows the model to "reason" over factual, real-time data.  
6. **Grounded Response Generation**: The LLM, now informed by the fresh search results, generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information.  
7. **Response Presentation with Sources** : The ADK receives the final grounded response, which includes the necessary source URLs and   
   groundingMetadata, and presents it to the user with attribution. This allows end-users to verify the information and builds trust in the agent's answers.

### Understanding grounding with Google Search response 

When the agent uses Google Search to ground a response, it returns a detailed set of information that includes not only the final text answer but also the sources it used to generate that answer. This metadata is crucial for verifying the response and for providing attribution to the original sources.

#### **Example of a Grounded Response**

The following is an example of the content object returned by the model after a grounded query.

**Final Answer Text:**

```
"Yes, Inter Miami won their last game in the FIFA Club World Cup. They defeated FC Porto 2-1 in their second group stage match. Their first game in the tournament was a 0-0 draw against Al Ahly FC. Inter Miami is scheduled to play their third group stage match against Palmeiras on Monday, June 23, 2025."
```

**Grounding Metadata Snippet:**

```json
"groundingMetadata": {
  "groundingChunks": [
    { "web": { "title": "mlssoccer.com", "uri": "..." } },
    { "web": { "title": "intermiamicf.com", "uri": "..." } },
    { "web": { "title": "mlssoccer.com", "uri": "..." } }
  ],
  "groundingSupports": [
    {
      "groundingChunkIndices": [0, 1],
      "segment": {
        "startIndex": 65,
        "endIndex": 126,
        "text": "They defeated FC Porto 2-1 in their second group stage match."
      }
    },
    {
      "groundingChunkIndices": [1],
      "segment": {
        "startIndex": 127,
        "endIndex": 196,
        "text": "Their first game in the tournament was a 0-0 draw against Al Ahly FC."
      }
    },
    {
      "groundingChunkIndices": [0, 2],
      "segment": {
        "startIndex": 197,
        "endIndex": 303,
        "text": "Inter Miami is scheduled to play their third group stage match against Palmeiras on Monday, June 23, 2025."
      }
    }
  ],
  "searchEntryPoint": { ... }
}

```

#### **How to Interpret the Response**

The metadata provides a link between the text generated by the model and the sources that support it. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **groundingChunks**: This is a list of the web pages the model consulted. Each chunk contains the title of the webpage and a uri that links to the source.  
2. **groundingSupports**: This list connects specific sentences in the final answer back to the groundingChunks.  
   * **segment**: This object identifies a specific portion of the final text answer, defined by its startIndex, endIndex, and the text itself.  
   * **groundingChunkIndices**: This array contains the index numbers that correspond to the sources listed in the groundingChunks. For example, the sentence "They defeated FC Porto 2-1..." is supported by information from groundingChunks at index 0 and 1 (both from mlssoccer.com and intermiamicf.com).

### How to display grounding responses with Google Search

A critical part of using grounding is to correctly display the information, including citations and search suggestions, to the end-user. This builds trust and allows users to verify the information.

![Responnses from Google Search](../assets/google_search_grd_resp.png)

#### **Displaying Search Suggestions**

The `searchEntryPoint` object in the `groundingMetadata` contains pre-formatted HTML for displaying search query suggestions. As seen in the example image, these are typically rendered as clickable chips that allow the user to explore related topics.

**Rendered HTML from searchEntryPoint:** The metadata provides the necessary HTML and CSS to render the search suggestions bar, which includes the Google logo and chips for related queries like "When is the next FIFA Club World Cup" and "Inter Miami FIFA Club World Cup history". Integrating this HTML directly into your application's front end will display the suggestions as intended.

For more information, consult [using Google Search Suggestions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/grounding-search-suggestions) in Vertex AI documentation.

## Summary

Google Search Grounding transforms AI agents from static knowledge repositories into dynamic, web-connected assistants capable of providing real-time, accurate information. By integrating this feature into your ADK agents, you enable them to:

- Access current information beyond their training data
- Provide source attribution for transparency and trust
- Deliver comprehensive answers with verifiable facts
- Enhance user experience with relevant search suggestions

The grounding process seamlessly connects user queries to Google's vast search index, enriching responses with up-to-date context while maintaining the conversational flow. With proper implementation and display of grounded responses, your agents become powerful tools for information discovery and decision-making.

# Understanding Vertex AI Search Grounding

[Vertex AI Search Grounding tool](../tools/built-in-tools.md#vertex-ai-search) is a powerful feature in the Agent Development Kit (ADK) that enables AI agents to access information from your private enterprise documents and data repositories. By connecting your agents to indexed enterprise content, you can provide users with answers grounded in your organization's knowledge base.

This feature is particularly valuable for enterprise-specific queries requiring information from internal documentation, policies, research papers, or any proprietary content that has been indexed in your [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/enterprise-search) datastore. When your agent determines that information from your knowledge base is needed, it automatically searches your indexed documents and incorporates the results into its response with proper attribution.

## What You'll Learn

In this guide, you'll discover:

- **Quick Setup**: How to create and run a Vertex AI Search-enabled agent from scratch
- **Grounding Architecture**: The data flow and technical process behind enterprise document grounding
- **Response Structure**: How to interpret grounded responses and their metadata
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for displaying citations and document references to users

## Vertex AI Search Grounding Quickstart

This quickstart guides you through creating an ADK agent with Vertex AI Search grounding feature. This quickstart assumes a local IDE (VS Code or PyCharm, etc.) with Python 3.9+ and terminal access.

### 1. Prepare Vertex AI Search { #prepare-vertex-ai-search }

If you already have a Vertex AI Search Data Store and its Data Store ID, you can skip this section. If not, follow the instruction in the [Get started with custom search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#unstructured-data) until the end of [Create a data store](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#create_a_data_store), with selecting the `Unstructured data` tab. With this instruction, you will build a sample Data Store with earning report PDFs from the [Alphabet investor site](https://abc.xyz/).

After finishing the Create a data store section, open the [Data Stores](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder/data-stores/) and select the data store you created, and find the `Data store ID`:

![Vertex AI Search Data Store](../assets/vertex_ai_search_grd_data_store.png)

Note this `Data store ID` as we will use this later.

### 2. Set up Environment & Install ADK { #set-up-environment-install-adk }

Create & Activate Virtual Environment:

```bash
# Create
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (each new terminal)
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install ADK:

```bash
pip install google-adk==1.5.0
```

### 3. Create Agent Project { #create-agent-project }

Under a project directory, run the following commands:

=== "OS X &amp; Linux"
    ```bash
    # Step 1: Create a new directory for your agent
    mkdir vertex_search_agent

    # Step 2: Create __init__.py for the agent
    echo "from . import agent" > vertex_search_agent/__init__.py

    # Step 3: Create an agent.py (the agent definition) and .env (authentication config)
    touch vertex_search_agent/agent.py .env
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```shell
    # Step 1: Create a new directory for your agent
    mkdir vertex_search_agent

    # Step 2: Create __init__.py for the agent
    echo "from . import agent" > vertex_search_agent/__init__.py

    # Step 3: Create an agent.py (the agent definition) and .env (authentication config)
    type nul > vertex_search_agent\agent.py 
    type nul > google_search_agent\.env
    ```

#### Edit `agent.py`

Copy and paste the following code into `agent.py`, and replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_DATASTORE_ID` at the `Configuration` part with your project ID and Data Store ID accordingly:

```python title="vertex_search_agent/agent.py"
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import VertexAiSearchTool

# Configuration
DATASTORE_ID = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/YOUR_DATASTORE_ID"

root_agent = Agent(
    name="vertex_search_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="Answer questions using Vertex AI Search to find information from internal documents. Always cite sources when available.",
    description="Enterprise document search assistant with Vertex AI Search capabilities",
    tools=[VertexAiSearchTool(data_store_id=DATASTORE_ID)]
)
```

Now you would have the following directory structure:

```console
my_project/
    vertex_search_agent/
        __init__.py
        agent.py
    .env
```

### 4. Authentication Setup { #authentication-setup }

**Note: Vertex AI Search requires Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI) authentication. Google AI Studio is not supported for this tool.**

  * Set up the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
  * Authenticate to Google Cloud, from the terminal by running `gcloud auth login`.
  * Open the **`.env`** file and copy-paste the following code and update the project ID and location.

    ```env title=".env"
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=LOCATION
    ```

There are multiple ways to interact with your agent:

=== "Dev UI (adk web)"
    Run the following command to launch the **dev UI**.

    ```shell
    adk web
    ```
    
    !!!info "Note for Windows users"

        When hitting the `_make_subprocess_transport NotImplementedError`, consider using `adk web --no-reload` instead.


    **Step 1:** Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8000` or
    `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) directly in your browser.

    **Step 2.** In the top-left corner of the UI, you can select your agent in
    the dropdown. Select "vertex_search_agent".

    !!!note "Troubleshooting"

        If you do not see "vertex_search_agent" in the dropdown menu, make sure you
        are running `adk web` in the **parent folder** of your agent folder
        (i.e. the parent folder of vertex_search_agent).

    **Step 3.** Now you can chat with your agent using the textbox.

=== "Terminal (adk run)"

    Run the following command, to chat with your Vertex AI Search agent.

    ```
    adk run vertex_search_agent
    ```
    To exit, use Cmd/Ctrl+C.

### 📝 Example prompts to try

With those questions, you can confirm that the agent is actually calling Vertex AI Search
to get information from the Alphabet reports:

* What is the revenue of Google Cloud in 2022 Q1?
* What about YouTube?

You've successfully created and interacted with your Vertex AI Search agent using ADK!

## How grounding with Vertex AI Search works

Grounding with Vertex AI Search is the process that connects your agent to your organization's indexed documents and data, allowing it to generate accurate responses based on private enterprise content. When a user's prompt requires information from your internal knowledge base, the agent's underlying LLM intelligently decides to invoke the `VertexAiSearchTool` to find relevant facts from your indexed documents.

### **Data Flow Diagram**

This diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of how a user query results in a grounded response.

![Vertex AI Search Grounding Data Flow](../assets/vertex_ai_search_grd_dataflow.png)

### **Detailed Description**

The grounding agent uses the data flow described in the diagram to retrieve, process, and incorporate enterprise information into the final answer presented to the user.

1. **User Query**: An end-user interacts with your agent by asking a question about internal documents or enterprise data.

2. **ADK Orchestration**: The Agent Development Kit orchestrates the agent's behavior and passes the user's message to the core of your agent.

3. **LLM Analysis and Tool-Calling**: The agent's LLM (e.g., a Gemini model) analyzes the prompt. If it determines that information from your indexed documents is required, it triggers the grounding mechanism by calling the VertexAiSearchTool. This is ideal for answering queries about company policies, technical documentation, or proprietary research.

4. **Vertex AI Search Service Interaction**: The VertexAiSearchTool interacts with your configured Vertex AI Search datastore, which contains your indexed enterprise documents. The service formulates and executes search queries against your private content.

5. **Document Retrieval & Ranking**: Vertex AI Search retrieves and ranks the most relevant document chunks from your datastore based on semantic similarity and relevance scoring.

6. **Context Injection**: The search service integrates the retrieved document snippets into the model's context before the final response is generated. This crucial step allows the model to "reason" over your organization's factual data.

7. **Grounded Response Generation**: The LLM, now informed by relevant enterprise content, generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information from your documents.

8. **Response Presentation with Sources**: The ADK receives the final grounded response, which includes the necessary source document references and groundingMetadata, and presents it to the user with attribution. This allows end-users to verify the information against your enterprise sources.

## Understanding grounding with Vertex AI Search response

When the agent uses Vertex AI Search to ground a response, it returns detailed information that includes the final text answer and metadata about the documents used to generate that answer. This metadata is crucial for verifying the response and providing attribution to your enterprise sources.

### Example of a Grounded Response

The following is an example of the content object returned by the model after a grounded query against enterprise documents.

**Final Answer Text:**

```
"Developing models for a medical scribe presents several significant challenges, primarily due to the complex nature of medical documentation, the sensitive data involved, and the demanding requirements of clinical workflows. Key challenges include: **Accuracy and Reliability:** Medical documentation requires extremely high levels of accuracy, as errors can lead to misdiagnoses, incorrect treatments, and legal repercussions. Ensuring that AI models can reliably capture nuanced medical language, distinguish between subjective and objective information, and accurately transcribe physician-patient interactions is a major hurdle. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Speech Recognition:** Medical conversations are often rapid, involve highly specialized jargon, acronyms, and abbreviations, and can be spoken by individuals with diverse accents or speech patterns... [response continues with detailed analysis of privacy, integration, and technical challenges]"
```

**Grounding Metadata Snippet:**

This is the grounding metadata you will receive. On `adk web`, you can find this on the `Response` tab:

```json
{
  "groundingMetadata": {
    "groundingChunks": [
      {
        "document": {
          "title": "AI in Medical Scribing: Technical Challenges",
          "uri": "projects/your-project/locations/global/dataStores/your-datastore-id/documents/doc-medical-scribe-ai-tech-challenges",
          "id": "doc-medical-scribe-ai-tech-challenges"
        }
      },
      {
        "document": {
          "title": "Regulatory and Ethical Hurdles for AI in Healthcare",
          "uri": "projects/your-project/locations/global/dataStores/your-datastore-id/documents/doc-ai-healthcare-ethics",
          "id": "doc-ai-healthcare-ethics"
        }
      }
      // ... additional documents
    ],
    "groundingSupports": [
      {
        "groundingChunkIndices": [0, 1],
        "segment": {
          "endIndex": 637,
          "startIndex": 433,
          "text": "Ensuring that AI models can reliably capture nuanced medical language..."
        }
      }
      // ... additional supports linking text segments to source documents
    ],
    "retrievalQueries": [
      "challenges in natural language processing medical domain",
      "AI medical scribe challenges",
      "difficulties in developing AI for medical scribes"
      // ... additional search queries executed
    ]
  }
}
```

### How to Interpret the Response

The metadata provides a link between the text generated by the model and the enterprise documents that support it. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

- **groundingChunks**: This is a list of the enterprise documents the model consulted. Each chunk contains the document title, uri (document path), and id.

- **groundingSupports**: This list connects specific sentences in the final answer back to the `groundingChunks`.

- **segment**: This object identifies a specific portion of the final text answer, defined by its `startIndex`, `endIndex`, and the `text` itself.

- **groundingChunkIndices**: This array contains the index numbers that correspond to the sources listed in the `groundingChunks`. For example, the text about "HIPAA compliance" is supported by information from `groundingChunks` at index 1 (the "Regulatory and Ethical Hurdles" document).

- **retrievalQueries**: This array shows the specific search queries that were executed against your datastore to find relevant information.

## How to display grounding responses with Vertex AI Search

Unlike Google Search grounding, Vertex AI Search grounding does not require specific display components. However, displaying citations and document references builds trust and allows users to verify information against your organization's authoritative sources.

### Optional Citation Display

Since grounding metadata is provided, you can choose to implement citation displays based on your application needs:

**Simple Text Display (Minimal Implementation):**

```python
for event in events:
    if event.is_final_response():
        print(event.content.parts[0].text)
        
        # Optional: Show source count
        if event.grounding_metadata:
            print(f"\nBased on {len(event.grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks)} documents")
```

**Enhanced Citation Display (Optional):** You can implement interactive citations that show which documents support each statement. The grounding metadata provides all necessary information to map text segments to source documents.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing Vertex AI Search grounding displays:

1. **Document Access**: Verify user permissions for referenced documents
2. **Simple Integration**: Basic text output requires no additional display logic
3. **Optional Enhancements**: Add citations only if your use case benefits from source attribution
4. **Document Links**: Convert document URIs to accessible internal links when needed
5. **Search Queries**: The retrievalQueries array shows what searches were performed against your datastore

## Summary

Vertex AI Search Grounding transforms AI agents from general-purpose assistants into enterprise-specific knowledge systems capable of providing accurate, source-attributed information from your organization's private documents. By integrating this feature into your ADK agents, you enable them to:

- Access proprietary information from your indexed document repositories
- Provide source attribution for transparency and trust
- Deliver comprehensive answers with verifiable enterprise facts
- Maintain data privacy within your Google Cloud environment

The grounding process seamlessly connects user queries to your organization's knowledge base, enriching responses with relevant context from your private documents while maintaining the conversational flow. With proper implementation, your agents become powerful tools for enterprise information discovery and decision-making.

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is
an open standard designed to standardize how Large Language Models (LLMs) like
Gemini and Claude communicate with external applications, data sources, and
tools. Think of it as a universal connection mechanism that simplifies how LLMs
obtain context, execute actions, and interact with various systems.

## How does MCP work?

MCP follows a client-server architecture, defining how data (resources),
interactive templates (prompts), and actionable functions (tools) are
exposed by an MCP server and consumed by an MCP client (which could be
an LLM host application or an AI agent).

## MCP Tools in ADK

ADK helps you both use and consume MCP tools in your agents, whether you're
trying to build a tool to call an MCP service, or exposing an MCP server for
other developers or agents to interact with your tools.

Refer to the [MCP Tools documentation](../tools/mcp-tools.md) for code samples
and design patterns that help you use ADK together with MCP servers, including:

- **Using Existing MCP Servers within ADK**: An ADK agent can act as an MCP
  client and use tools provided by external MCP servers.
- **Exposing ADK Tools via an MCP Server**: How to build an MCP server that
  wraps ADK tools, making them accessible to any MCP client.

## MCP Toolbox for Databases

[MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) is an
open-source MCP server that securely exposes your backend data sources as a
set of pre-built, production-ready tools for Gen AI agents. It functions as a

# Agent Observability with AgentOps

**With just two lines of code**, [AgentOps](https://www.agentops.ai) provides session replays, metrics, and monitoring for agents.

## Why AgentOps for ADK?

Observability is a key aspect of developing and deploying conversational AI agents. It allows developers to understand how their agents are performing, how their agents are interacting with users, and how their agents use external tools and APIs.

By integrating AgentOps, developers can gain deep insights into their ADK agent's behavior, LLM interactions, and tool usage.

Google ADK includes its own OpenTelemetry-based tracing system, primarily aimed at providing developers with a way to trace the basic flow of execution within their agents. AgentOps enhances this by offering a dedicated and more comprehensive observability platform with:

*   **Unified Tracing and Replay Analytics:** Consolidate traces from ADK and other components of your AI stack.
*   **Rich Visualization:** Intuitive dashboards to visualize agent execution flow, LLM calls, and tool performance.
*   **Detailed Debugging:** Drill down into specific spans, view prompts, completions, token counts, and errors.
*   **LLM Cost and Latency Tracking:** Track latencies, costs (via token usage), and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Simplified Setup:** Get started with just a few lines of code.

![AgentOps Agent Observability Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/refs/heads/main/docs/images/external/app_screenshots/overview.png)

![AgentOps Dashboard showing an ADK trace with nested agent, LLM, and tool spans.](../assets/agentops-adk-trace-example.jpg)

*AgentOps dashboard displaying a trace from a multi-step ADK application execution. You can see the hierarchical structure of spans, including the main agent workflow, individual sub-agents, LLM calls, and tool executions. Note the clear hierarchy: the main workflow agent span contains child spans for various sub-agent operations, LLM calls, and tool executions.*

## Getting Started with AgentOps and ADK

Integrating AgentOps into your ADK application is straightforward:

1.  **Install AgentOps:**
    ```bash
    pip install -U agentops
    ```

2. **Create an API Key**
    Create a user API key here: [Create API Key](https://app.agentops.ai/settings/projects) and configure your environment:

    Add your API key to your environment variables:
    ```
    AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>
    ```

3.  **Initialize AgentOps:**
    Add the following lines at the beginning of your ADK application script (e.g., your main Python file running the ADK `Runner`):

    ```python
    import agentops
    agentops.init()
    ```

    This will initiate an AgentOps session as well as automatically track ADK agents.

    Detailed example:

    ```python
    import agentops
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables (optional, if you use a .env file for API keys)
    load_dotenv()

    agentops.init(
        api_key=os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY"), # Your AgentOps API Key
        trace_name="my-adk-app-trace"  # Optional: A name for your trace
        # auto_start_session=True is the default.
        # Set to False if you want to manually control session start/end.
    )
    ```

    > 🚨 🔑 You can find your AgentOps API key on your [AgentOps Dashboard](https://app.agentops.ai/) after signing up. It's recommended to set it as an environment variable (`AGENTOPS_API_KEY`).

Once initialized, AgentOps will automatically begin instrumenting your ADK agent.

**This is all you need to capture all telemetry data for your ADK agent**

## How AgentOps Instruments ADK

AgentOps employs a sophisticated strategy to provide seamless observability without conflicting with ADK's native telemetry:

1.  **Neutralizing ADK's Native Telemetry:**
    AgentOps detects ADK and intelligently patches ADK's internal OpenTelemetry tracer (typically `trace.get_tracer('gcp.vertex.agent')`). It replaces it with a `NoOpTracer`, ensuring that ADK's own attempts to create telemetry spans are effectively silenced. This prevents duplicate traces and allows AgentOps to be the authoritative source for observability data.

2.  **AgentOps-Controlled Span Creation:**
    AgentOps takes control by wrapping key ADK methods to create a logical hierarchy of spans:

    *   **Agent Execution Spans (e.g., `adk.agent.MySequentialAgent`):**
        When an ADK agent (like `BaseAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, or `LlmAgent`) starts its `run_async` method, AgentOps initiates a parent span for that agent's execution.

    *   **LLM Interaction Spans (e.g., `adk.llm.gemini-pro`):**
        For calls made by an agent to an LLM (via ADK's `BaseLlmFlow._call_llm_async`), AgentOps creates a dedicated child span, typically named after the LLM model. This span captures request details (prompts, model parameters) and, upon completion (via ADK's `_finalize_model_response_event`), records response details like completions, token usage, and finish reasons.

    *   **Tool Usage Spans (e.g., `adk.tool.MyCustomTool`):**
        When an agent uses a tool (via ADK's `functions.__call_tool_async`), AgentOps creates a single, comprehensive child span named after the tool. This span includes the tool's input parameters and the result it returns.

3.  **Rich Attribute Collection:**
    AgentOps reuses ADK's internal data extraction logic. It patches ADK's specific telemetry functions (e.g., `google.adk.telemetry.trace_tool_call`, `trace_call_llm`). The AgentOps wrappers for these functions take the detailed information ADK gathers and attach it as attributes to the *currently active AgentOps span*.

## Visualizing Your ADK Agent in AgentOps

When you instrument your ADK application with AgentOps, you gain a clear, hierarchical view of your agent's execution in the AgentOps dashboard.

1.  **Initialization:**
    When `agentops.init()` is called (e.g., `agentops.init(trace_name="my_adk_application")`), an initial parent span is created if the init param `auto_start_session=True` (true by default). This span, often named similar to `my_adk_application.session`, will be the root for all operations within that trace.

2.  **ADK Runner Execution:**
    When an ADK `Runner` executes a top-level agent (e.g., a `SequentialAgent` orchestrating a workflow), AgentOps creates a corresponding agent span under the session trace. This span will reflect the name of your top-level ADK agent (e.g., `adk.agent.YourMainWorkflowAgent`).

3.  **Sub-Agent and LLM/Tool Calls:**
    As this main agent executes its logic, including calling sub-agents, LLMs, or tools:
    *   Each **sub-agent execution** will appear as a nested child span under its parent agent.
    *   Calls to **Large Language Models** will generate further nested child spans (e.g., `adk.llm.<model_name>`), capturing prompt details, responses, and token usage.
    *   **Tool invocations** will also result in distinct child spans (e.g., `adk.tool.<your_tool_name>`), showing their parameters and results.

This creates a waterfall of spans, allowing you to see the sequence, duration, and details of each step in your ADK application. All relevant attributes, such as LLM prompts, completions, token counts, tool inputs/outputs, and agent names, are captured and displayed.

For a practical demonstration, you can explore a sample Jupyter Notebook that illustrates a human approval workflow using Google ADK and AgentOps:
[Google ADK Human Approval Example on GitHub](https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/agentops/blob/main/examples/google_adk/human_approval.ipynb).

This example showcases how a multi-step agent process with tool usage is visualized in AgentOps.

## Benefits

*   **Effortless Setup:** Minimal code changes for comprehensive ADK tracing.
*   **Deep Visibility:** Understand the inner workings of complex ADK agent flows.
*   **Faster Debugging:** Quickly pinpoint issues with detailed trace data.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze latencies and token usage.

By integrating AgentOps, ADK developers can significantly enhance their ability to build, debug, and maintain robust AI agents.

# Agent Observability with Cloud Trace

With ADK, you’ve already capable of inspecting and observing your agent interaction locally utilizing the powerful web development UI discussed in [here](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/#debugging-with-the-trace-view). However, if we aim for cloud deployment, we will need a centralized dashboard to observe real traffic.

Cloud Trace is a component of Google Cloud Observability. It is a powerful tool for monitoring, debugging, and improving the performance of your applications by focusing specifically on tracing capabilities. For Agent Development Kit (ADK) applications, Cloud Trace enables comprehensive tracing, helping you understand how requests flow through your agent's interactions and identify performance bottlenecks or errors within your AI agents.

## Overview

Cloud Trace is built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), an open-source standard that supports many languages and ingestion methods for generating trace data. This aligns with observability practices for ADK applications, which also leverage OpenTelemetry-compatible instrumentation, allowing you to :

- Trace agent interactions : Cloud Trace continuously gathers and analyzes trace data from your project, enabling you to rapidly diagnose latency issues and errors within your ADK applications. This automatic data collection simplifies the process of identifying problems in complex agent workflows.
- Debug issues : Quickly diagnose latency issues and errors by analyzing detailed traces. Crucial for understanding issues that manifest as increased communication latency across different services or during specific agent actions like tool calls.
- In-depth Analysis and Visualization: Trace Explorer is the primary tool for analyzing traces, offering visual aids like heatmaps for span duration and line charts for request/error rates. It also provides a spans table, groupable by service and operation, which gives one-click access to representative traces and a waterfall view to easily identify bottlenecks and sources of errors within your agent's execution path

The following example will assume the following agent directory structure

```
working_dir/
├── weather_agent/
│   ├── agent.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── deploy_agent_engine.py
└── deploy_fast_api_app.py
└── agent_runner.py
```

```python
# weather_agent/agent.py

import os
from google.adk.agents import Agent

os.environ.setdefault("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT", "{your-project-id}")
os.environ.setdefault("GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION", "global")
os.environ.setdefault("GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI", "True")


# Define a tool function
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves the current weather report for a specified city.

    Args:
        city (str): The name of the city for which to retrieve the weather report.

    Returns:
        dict: status and result or error msg.
    """
    if city.lower() == "new york":
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "report": (
                "The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees"
                " Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit)."
            ),
        }
    else:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error_message": f"Weather information for '{city}' is not available.",
        }


# Create an agent with tools
root_agent = Agent(
    name="weather_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="Agent to answer questions using weather tools.",
    instruction="You must use the available tools to find an answer.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)
```

## Cloud Trace Setup

### Setup for Agent Engine Deployment

#### Agent Engine Deployment - from ADK CLI

You can enable cloud tracing by adding `--trace_to_cloud` flag when deploying your agent using `adk deploy agent_engine` command for agent engine deployment.

```bash
adk deploy agent_engine \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    --region=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --staging_bucket=$STAGING_BUCKET \
    --trace_to_cloud \
    $AGENT_PATH
```

#### Agent Engine Deployment - from Python SDK

If you prefer using Python SDK, you can enable cloud tracing by adding `enable_tracing=True` when initialize the `AdkApp` object

```python
# deploy_agent_engine.py

from vertexai.preview import reasoning_engines
from vertexai import agent_engines
from weather_agent.agent import root_agent

import vertexai

PROJECT_ID = "{your-project-id}"
LOCATION = "{your-preferred-location}"
STAGING_BUCKET = "{your-staging-bucket}"

vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET,
)

adk_app = reasoning_engines.AdkApp(
    agent=root_agent,
    enable_tracing=True,
)


remote_app = agent_engines.create(
    agent_engine=adk_app,
    extra_packages=[
        "./weather_agent",
    ],
    requirements=[
        "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]",
    ],
)
```

### Setup for Cloud Run Deployment

#### Cloud Run Deployment - from ADK CLI

You can enable cloud tracing by adding `--trace_to_cloud` flag when deploying your agent using `adk deploy cloud_run` command for cloud run deployment.

```bash
adk deploy cloud_run \
    --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
    --region=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION \
    --trace_to_cloud \
    $AGENT_PATH
```

If you want to enable cloud tracing and using a customized agent service deployment on Cloud Run, you can refer to the [Setup for Customized Deployment](#setup-for-customized-deployment) section below

### Setup for Customized Deployment

#### From Built-in `get_fast_api_app` Module

If you want to customize your own agent service, you can enable cloud tracing by initialize the FastAPI app using built-in `get_fast_api_app` module and set `trace_to_cloud=True`

```python
# deploy_fast_api_app.py

import os
from google.adk.cli.fast_api import get_fast_api_app
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable for cloud tracing
os.environ.setdefault("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT", "alvin-exploratory-2")

# Discover the `weather_agent` directory in current working dir
AGENT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Create FastAPI app with enabled cloud tracing
app: FastAPI = get_fast_api_app(
    agents_dir=AGENT_DIR,
    web=True,
    trace_to_cloud=True,
)

app.title = "weather-agent"
app.description = "API for interacting with the Agent weather-agent"


# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn

    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```


#### From Customized Agent Runner

If you want to fully customize your ADK agent runtime, you can enable cloud tracing by using `CloudTraceSpanExporter` module from Opentelemetry.

```python
# agent_runner.py

from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from weather_agent.agent import root_agent as weather_agent
from google.genai.types import Content, Part
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.cloud_trace import CloudTraceSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import export
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider

APP_NAME = "weather_agent"
USER_ID = "u_123"
SESSION_ID = "s_123"

provider = TracerProvider()
processor = export.BatchSpanProcessor(
    CloudTraceSpanExporter(project_id="{your-project-id}")
)
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

session_service = InMemorySessionService()
runner = Runner(agent=weather_agent, app_name=APP_NAME, session_service=session_service)


async def main():
    session = await session_service.get_session(
        app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=SESSION_ID
    )
    if session is None:
        session = await session_service.create_session(
            app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=SESSION_ID
        )

    user_content = Content(
        role="user", parts=[Part(text="what's weather in paris?")]
    )

    final_response_content = "No response"
    async for event in runner.run_async(
        user_id=USER_ID, session_id=SESSION_ID, new_message=user_content
    ):
        if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:
            final_response_content = event.content.parts[0].text

    print(final_response_content)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Inspect Cloud Traces

After the setup is complete, whenever you interact with the agent it will automatically send trace data to Cloud Trace. You can inspect the traces by going to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and visit the Trace Explorer on the configured Google Cloud Project

![cloud-trace](../assets/cloud-trace1.png)

And then you will see all available traces produced by ADK agent which configured in several span names such as `invocation` , `agent_run` . `call_llm` and `execute_tool`

![cloud-trace](../assets/cloud-trace2.png)

If you click on one of the traces, you will see the waterfall view of the detailed process, similar to what we see in the web development UI with `adk web` command.

# Logging in the Agent Development Kit (ADK)

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) uses Python's standard `logging` module to provide flexible and powerful logging capabilities. Understanding how to configure and interpret these logs is crucial for monitoring agent behavior and debugging issues effectively.

## Logging Philosophy

ADK's approach to logging is to provide detailed diagnostic information without being overly verbose by default. It is designed to be configured by the application developer, allowing you to tailor the log output to your specific needs, whether in a development or production environment.

- **Standard Library:** It uses the standard `logging` library, so any configuration or handler that works with it will work with ADK.
- **Hierarchical Loggers:** Loggers are named hierarchically based on the module path (e.g., `google_adk.google.adk.agents.llm_agent`), allowing for fine-grained control over which parts of the framework produce logs.
- **User-Configured:** The framework does not configure logging itself. It is the responsibility of the developer using the framework to set up the desired logging configuration in their application's entry point.

## How to Configure Logging

You can configure logging in your main application script (e.g., `main.py`) before you initialize and run your agent. The simplest way is to use `logging.basicConfig`.

### Example Configuration

To enable detailed logging, including `DEBUG` level messages, add the following to the top of your script:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s'
)

# Your ADK agent code follows...
# from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
# ...
```

### Configuring Logging with the ADK CLI

When running agents using the ADK's built-in web or API servers, you can easily control the log verbosity directly from the command line. The `adk web`, `adk api_server`, and `adk deploy cloud_run` commands all accept a `--log_level` option.

This provides a convenient way to set the logging level without modifying your agent's source code.

> **Note:** The command-line setting always takes precedence over the programmatic configuration (like `logging.basicConfig`) for ADK's loggers. It's recommended to use `INFO` or `WARNING` in production and enable `DEBUG` only when troubleshooting.

**Example using `adk web`:**

To start the web server with `DEBUG` level logging, run:

```bash
adk web --log_level DEBUG path/to/your/agents_dir
```

The available log levels for the `--log_level` option are:

- `DEBUG`
- `INFO` (default)
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`
- `CRITICAL`

> You can also use `-v` or `--verbose` as a a shortcut for `--log_level DEBUG`.
>
> ```bash
> adk web -v path/to/your/agents_dir
> ```

### Log Levels

ADK uses standard log levels to categorize messages. The configured level determines what information gets logged.

| Level | Description | Type of Information Logged  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`DEBUG`** | **Crucial for debugging.** The most verbose level for fine-grained diagnostic information. | <ul><li>**Full LLM Prompts:** The complete request sent to the language model, including system instructions, history, and tools.</li><li>Detailed API responses from services.</li><li>Internal state transitions and variable values.</li></ul> |
| **`INFO`** | General information about the agent's lifecycle. | <ul><li>Agent initialization and startup.</li><li>Session creation and deletion events.</li><li>Execution of a tool, including its name and arguments.</li></ul> |
| **`WARNING`** | Indicates a potential issue or deprecated feature use. The agent continues to function, but attention may be required. | <ul><li>Use of deprecated methods or parameters.</li><li>Non-critical errors that the system recovered from.</li></ul> |
| **`ERROR`** | A serious error that prevented an operation from completing. | <ul><li>Failed API calls to external services (e.g., LLM, Session Service).</li><li>Unhandled exceptions during agent execution.</li><li>Configuration errors.</li></ul> |

> **Note:** It is recommended to use `INFO` or `WARNING` in production environments. Only enable `DEBUG` when actively troubleshooting an issue, as `DEBUG` logs can be very verbose and may contain sensitive information.

## Reading and Understanding the Logs

The `format` string in the `basicConfig` example determines the structure of each log message.  

Here’s a sample log entry:

```text
2025-07-08 11:22:33,456 - DEBUG - google_adk.google.adk.models.google_llm - LLM Request: contents { ... }
```

| Log Segment                     | Format Specifier | Meaning                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `2025-07-08 11:22:33,456`       | `%(asctime)s`    | Timestamp                                      |
| `DEBUG`                         | `%(levelname)s`  | Severity level                                 |
| `google_adk.models.google_llm`  | `%(name)s`       | Logger name (the module that produced the log) |
| `LLM Request: contents { ... }` | `%(message)s`    | The actual log message                         |

By reading the logger name, you can immediately pinpoint the source of the log and understand its context within the agent's architecture.

## Debugging with Logs: A Practical Example

**Scenario:** Your agent is not producing the expected output, and you suspect the prompt being sent to the LLM is incorrect or missing information.

**Steps:**

1.  **Enable DEBUG Logging:** In your `main.py`, set the logging level to `DEBUG` as shown in the configuration example.

    ```python
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.DEBUG,
        format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s'
    )
    ```

2.  **Run Your Agent:** Execute your agent's task as you normally would.

3.  **Inspect the Logs:** Look through the console output for a message from the `google.adk.models.google_llm` logger that starts with `LLM Request:`.

    ```log
    ...
    2025-07-10 15:26:13,778 - DEBUG - google_adk.google.adk.models.google_llm - Sending out request, model: gemini-2.0-flash, backend: GoogleLLMVariant.GEMINI_API, stream: False
    2025-07-10 15:26:13,778 - DEBUG - google_adk.google.adk.models.google_llm - 
    LLM Request:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    System Instruction:

          You roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.
          You can roll dice of different sizes.
          You can use multiple tools in parallel by calling functions in parallel(in one request and in one round).
          It is ok to discuss previous dice roles, and comment on the dice rolls.
          When you are asked to roll a die, you must call the roll_die tool with the number of sides. Be sure to pass in an integer. Do not pass in a string.
          You should never roll a die on your own.
          When checking prime numbers, call the check_prime tool with a list of integers. Be sure to pass in a list of integers. You should never pass in a string.
          You should not check prime numbers before calling the tool.
          When you are asked to roll a die and check prime numbers, you should always make the following two function calls:
          1. You should first call the roll_die tool to get a roll. Wait for the function response before calling the check_prime tool.
          2. After you get the function response from roll_die tool, you should call the check_prime tool with the roll_die result.
            2.1 If user asks you to check primes based on previous rolls, make sure you include the previous rolls in the list.
          3. When you respond, you must include the roll_die result from step 1.
          You should always perform the previous 3 steps when asking for a roll and checking prime numbers.
          You should not rely on the previous history on prime results.
        

    You are an agent. Your internal name is "hello_world_agent".

    The description about you is "hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers."
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Contents:
    {"parts":[{"text":"Roll a 6 sided dice"}],"role":"user"}
    {"parts":[{"function_call":{"args":{"sides":6},"name":"roll_die"}}],"role":"model"}
    {"parts":[{"function_response":{"name":"roll_die","response":{"result":2}}}],"role":"user"}
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Functions:
    roll_die: {'sides': {'type': <Type.INTEGER: 'INTEGER'>}} 
    check_prime: {'nums': {'items': {'type': <Type.INTEGER: 'INTEGER'>}, 'type': <Type.ARRAY: 'ARRAY'>}} 
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    2025-07-10 15:26:13,779 - INFO - google_genai.models - AFC is enabled with max remote calls: 10.
    2025-07-10 15:26:14,309 - INFO - google_adk.google.adk.models.google_llm - 
    LLM Response:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Text:
    I have rolled a 6 sided die, and the result is 2.
    ...
    ```

4.  **Analyze the Prompt:** By examining the `System Instruction`, `contents`, `functions` sections of the logged request, you can verify:
    -   Is the system instruction correct?
    -   Is the conversation history (`user` and `model` turns) accurate?
    -   Is the most recent user query included?
    -   Are the correct tools being provided to the model?
    -   Are the tools correctly called by the model?
    -   How long it takes for the model to respond?

This detailed output allows you to diagnose a wide range of issues, from incorrect prompt engineering to problems with tool definitions, directly from the log files.

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install google-adk opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
```

## Sending Traces to Weave

This example demonstrates how to configure OpenTelemetry to send Google ADK traces to Weave.

```python
# math_agent/agent.py

import base64
import os
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk import trace as trace_sdk
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry import trace

from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Configure Weave endpoint and authentication
WANDB_BASE_URL = "https://trace.wandb.ai"
PROJECT_ID = "your-entity/your-project"  # e.g., "teamid/projectid"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = f"{WANDB_BASE_URL}/otel/v1/traces"

# Set up authentication
WANDB_API_KEY = os.getenv("WANDB_API_KEY")
AUTH = base64.b64encode(f"api:{WANDB_API_KEY}".encode()).decode()

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Basic {AUTH}",
    "project_id": PROJECT_ID,
}

# Create the OTLP span exporter with endpoint and headers
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT,
    headers=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS,
)

# Create a tracer provider and add the exporter
tracer_provider = trace_sdk.TracerProvider()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter))

# Set the global tracer provider BEFORE importing/using ADK
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

# Define a simple tool for demonstration
def calculator(a: float, b: float) -> str:
    """Add two numbers and return the result.

    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b
    """
    return str(a + b)

calculator_tool = FunctionTool(func=calculator)

# Create an LLM agent
root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="MathAgent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction=(
        "You are a helpful assistant that can do math. "
        "When asked a math problem, use the calculator tool to solve it."
    ),
    tools=[calculator_tool],
)
```

## View Traces in Weave dashboard

Once the agent runs, all its traces are logged to the corresponding project on [the Weave dashboard](https://wandb.ai/home).

![Traces in Weave](https://wandb.github.io/weave-public-assets/google-adk/traces-overview.png)

You can view a timeline of calls that your ADK agent made during execution -

![Timeline view](https://wandb.github.io/weave-public-assets/google-adk/adk-weave-timeline.gif)


## Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your environment variables are correctly set for both WandB and Google API keys.
- **Project Configuration**: Replace `<your-entity>/<your-project>` with your actual WandB entity and project name.
- **Entity Name**: You can find your entity name by visiting your [WandB dashboard](https://wandb.ai/home) and checking the **Teams** field in the left sidebar.
- **Tracer Provider**: It's critical to set the global tracer provider before using any ADK components to ensure proper tracing.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate Google ADK with Weave, enabling comprehensive logging and visualization of your AI agents' model calls, tool invocations, and reasoning processes.

# Plugins

A Plugin in Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a custom code module that can be
executed at various stages of an agent workflow lifecycle using callback hooks.
You use Plugins for functionality that is applicable across your agent workflow.
Some typical applications of Plugins are as follows:

-   **Logging and tracing**: Create detailed logs of agent, tool, and
    generative AI model activity for debugging and performance analysis.
-   **Policy enforcement**: Implement security guardrails, such as a
    function that checks if users are authorized to use a specific tool and
    prevent its execution if they do not have permission.
-   **Monitoring and metrics**: Collect and export metrics on token usage,
    execution times, and invocation counts to monitoring systems such as
    Prometheus or 
    [Google Cloud Observability](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs) 
    (formerly Stackdriver).
-   **Response caching**: Check if a request has been made before, so you
    can return a cached response, skipping expensive or time consuming AI model
    or tool calls.
-   **Request or response modification**: Dynamically add information to AI
    model prompts or standardize tool output responses.

!!! tip
    When implementing security guardrails and policies, use ADK Plugins for
    better modularity and flexibility than Callbacks. For more details, see 
    [Callbacks and Plugins for Security Guardrails](/adk-docs/safety/#callbacks-and-plugins-for-security-guardrails).

!!! warning "Caution"
    Plugins are not supported by the 
    [ADK web interface](../evaluate/#1-adk-web-run-evaluations-via-the-web-ui). 
    If your ADK workflow uses Plugins, you must run your workflow without the 
    web interface.

## How do Plugins work?

An ADK Plugin extends the `BasePlugin` class and contains one or more
`callback` methods, indicating where in the agent lifecycle the Plugin should be
executed. You integrate Plugins into an agent by registering them in your
agent's `Runner` class. For more information on how and where you can trigger
Plugins in your agent application, see
[Plugin callback hooks](#plugin-callback-hooks).

Plugin functionality builds on
[Callbacks](../callbacks/), which is a key design
element of the ADK's extensible architecture. While a typical Agent Callback is
configured on a *single agent, a single tool* for a *specific task*, a Plugin is
registered *once* on the `Runner` and its callbacks apply *globally* to every
agent, tool, and LLM call managed by that runner. Plugins let you package
related callback functions together to be used across a workflow. This makes
Plugins an ideal solution for implementing features that cut across your entire
agent application.

## Define and register Plugins

This section explains how to define Plugin classes and register them as part of
your agent workflow. For a complete code example, see
[Plugin Basic](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/plugin_basic)
in the repository.

### Create Plugin class

Start by extending the `BasePlugin` class and add one or more `callback`
methods, as shown in the following code example:

```py title="count_plugin.py"
from google.adk.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent
from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext
from google.adk.models.llm_request import LlmRequest
from google.adk.plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin

class CountInvocationPlugin(BasePlugin):
  """A custom plugin that counts agent and tool invocations."""

  def __init__(self) -> None:
    """Initialize the plugin with counters."""
    super().__init__(name="count_invocation")
    self.agent_count: int = 0
    self.tool_count: int = 0
    self.llm_request_count: int = 0

  async def before_agent_callback(
      self, *, agent: BaseAgent, callback_context: CallbackContext
  ) -> None:
    """Count agent runs."""
    self.agent_count += 1
    print(f"[Plugin] Agent run count: {self.agent_count}")

  async def before_model_callback(
      self, *, callback_context: CallbackContext, llm_request: LlmRequest
  ) -> None:
    """Count LLM requests."""
    self.llm_request_count += 1
    print(f"[Plugin] LLM request count: {self.llm_request_count}")
```

This example code implements callbacks for `before_agent_callback` and
`before_model_callback` to count execution of these tasks during the lifecycle
of the agent.

### Register Plugin class

Integrate your Plugin class by registering it during your agent initialization
as part of your `Runner` class, using the `plugins` parameter. You can specify
multiple Plugins with this parameter. The following code example shows how to
register the `CountInvocationPlugin` plugin defined in the previous section with
a simple ADK agent.

```py
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext
from google.genai import types
import asyncio

# Import the plugin.
from .count_plugin import CountInvocationPlugin

async def hello_world(tool_context: ToolContext, query: str):
  print(f'Hello world: query is [{query}]')

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='hello_world',
    description='Prints hello world with user query.',
    instruction="""Use hello_world tool to print hello world and user query.
    """,
    tools=[hello_world],
)

async def main():
  """Main entry point for the agent."""
  prompt = 'hello world'
  runner = InMemoryRunner(
      agent=root_agent,
      app_name='test_app_with_plugin',

      # Add your plugin here. You can add multiple plugins.
      plugins=[CountInvocationPlugin()],
  )

  # The rest is the same as starting a regular ADK runner.
  session = await runner.session_service.create_session(
      user_id='user',
      app_name='test_app_with_plugin',
  )

  async for event in runner.run_async(
      user_id='user',
      session_id=session.id,
      new_message=types.Content(
        role='user', parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=prompt)]
      )
  ):
    print(f'** Got event from {event.author}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())
```

### Run the agent with the Plugin

Run the plugin as you typically would. The following shows how to run the
command line:

```sh
python3 -m path.to.main
```

Plugins are not supported by the
[ADK web interface](../evaluate/#1-adk-web-run-evaluations-via-the-web-ui).
If your ADK workflow uses Plugins, you must run your workflow without the web
interface.

The output of this previously described agent should look similar to the
following:

```log
[Plugin] Agent run count: 1
[Plugin] LLM request count: 1
** Got event from hello_world
Hello world: query is [hello world]
** Got event from hello_world
[Plugin] LLM request count: 2
** Got event from hello_world
```


For more information on running ADK agents, see the
[Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart/#run-your-agent)
guide.

## Build workflows with Plugins

Plugin callback hooks are a mechanism for implementing logic that intercepts,
modifies, and even controls the agent's execution lifecycle. Each hook is a
specific method in your Plugin class that you can implement to run code at a key
moment. You have a choice between two modes of operation based on your hook's
return value:

-   **To Observe:** Implement a hook with no return value (`None`). This
    approach is for tasks such as logging or collecting metrics, as it allows
    the agent's workflow to proceed to the next step without interruption. For
    example, you could use `after_tool_callback` in a Plugin to log every
    tool's result for debugging.
-   **To Intervene:** Implement a hook and return a value. This approach
    short-circuits the workflow. The `Runner` halts processing, skips any
    subsequent plugins and the original intended action, like a Model call, and
    use a Plugin callback's return value as the result. A common use case is
    implementing `before_model_callback` to return a cached `LlmResponse`,
    preventing a redundant and costly API call.
-   **To Amend:** Implement a hook and modify the Context object. This
    approach allows you to modify the context data for the module to be
    executed without otherwise interrupting the execution of that module. For
    example, adding additional, standardized prompt text for Model object execution.

**Caution:** Plugin callback functions have precedence over callbacks
implemented at the object level. This behavior means that Any Plugin callbacks
code is executed *before* any Agent, Model, or Tool objects callbacks are
executed. Furthermore, if a Plugin-level agent callback returns any value, and
not an empty (`None`) response, the Agent, Model, or Tool-level callback is *not
executed* (skipped).

The Plugin design establishes a hierarchy of code execution and separates
global concerns from local agent logic. A Plugin is the stateful *module* you
build, such as `PerformanceMonitoringPlugin`, while the callback hooks are the
specific *functions* within that module that get executed. This architecture
differs fundamentally from standard Agent Callbacks in these critical ways:

-   **Scope:** Plugin hooks are *global*. You register a Plugin once on the
    `Runner`, and its hooks apply universally to every Agent, Model, and Tool
    it manages. In contrast, Agent Callbacks are *local*, configured
    individually on a specific agent instance.
-   **Execution Order:** Plugins have *precedence*. For any given event, the
    Plugin hooks always run before any corresponding Agent Callback. This
    system behavior makes Plugins the correct architectural choice for
    implementing cross-cutting features like security policies, universal
    caching, and consistent logging across your entire application.

### Agent Callbacks and Plugins

As mentioned in the previous section, there are some functional similarities
between Plugins and Agent Callbacks. The following table compares the
differences between Plugins and Agent Callbacks in more detail.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th><strong>Plugins</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Agent Callbacks</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Scope</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Global</strong>: Apply to all agents/tools/LLMs in the
<code>Runner</code>.</td>
      <td><strong>Local</strong>: Apply only to the specific agent instance
they are configured on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Primary Use Case</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Horizontal Features</strong>: Logging, policy, monitoring,
global caching.</td>
      <td><strong>Specific Agent Logic</strong>: Modifying the behavior or
state of a single agent.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Configuration</strong></td>
      <td>Configure once on the <code>Runner</code>.</td>
      <td>Configure individually on each <code>BaseAgent</code> instance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Execution Order</strong></td>
      <td>Plugin callbacks run <strong>before</strong> Agent Callbacks.</td>
      <td>Agent callbacks run <strong>after</strong> Plugin callbacks.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Plugin callback hooks

You define when a Plugin is called with the callback functions to define in
your Plugin class. Callbacks are available when a user message is received,
before and after an `Runner`, `Agent`, `Model`, or `Tool` is called, for
`Events`, and when a `Model`, or `Tool` error occurs. These callbacks include,
and take precedence over, the any callbacks defined within your Agent, Model,
and Tool classes.

The following diagram illustrates callback points where you can attach and run
Plugin functionality during your agents workflow:

![ADK Plugin callback hooks](../assets/workflow-plugin-hooks.svg)
**Figure 1.** Diagram of ADK agent workflow with Plugin callback hook
locations.

The following sections describe the available callback hooks for Plugins in
more detail.

-   [User Message callbacks](#user-message-callbacks)
-   [Runner start callbacks](#runner-start-callbacks)
-   [Agent execution callbacks](#agent-execution-callbacks)
-   [Model callbacks](#model-callbacks)
-   [Tool callbacks](#tool-callbacks)
-   [Runner end callbacks](#runner-end-callbacks)

### User Message callbacks

*A User Message c*allback (`on_user_message_callback`) happens when a user
sends a message. The `on_user_message_callback` is the very first hook to run,
giving you a chance to inspect or modify the initial input.\

-   **When It Runs:** This callback happens immediately after
    `runner.run()`, before any other processing.
-   **Purpose:** The first opportunity to inspect or modify the user's raw
    input.
-   **Flow Control:** Returns a `types.Content` object to **replace** the
    user's original message.

The following code example shows the basic syntax of this callback:

```py
async def on_user_message_callback(
    self,
    *,
    invocation_context: InvocationContext,
    user_message: types.Content,
) -> Optional[types.Content]:
```

### Runner start callbacks

A *Runner start* callback (`before_run_callback`) happens when the `Runner`
object takes the potentially modified user message and prepares for execution.
The `before_run_callback` fires here, allowing for global setup before any agent
logic begins.

-   **When It Runs:** Immediately after `runner.run()` is called, before
    any other processing.
-   **Purpose:** The first opportunity to inspect or modify the user's raw
    input.
-   **Flow Control:** Return a `types.Content` object to **replace** the
    user's original message.

The following code example shows the basic syntax of this callback:

```py
async def before_run_callback(
    self, *, invocation_context: InvocationContext
) -> Optional[types.Content]:
```

### Agent execution callbacks

*Agent execution* callbacks (`before_agent`, `after_agent`) happen when a
`Runner` object invokes an agent. The `before_agent_callback` runs immediately
before the agent's main work begins. The main work encompasses the agent's
entire process for handling the request, which could involve calling models or
tools. After the agent has finished all its steps and prepared a result, the
`after_agent_callback` runs.

**Caution:** Plugins that implement these callbacks are executed *before* the
Agent-level callbacks are executed. Furthermore, if a Plugin-level agent
callback returns anything other than a `None` or null response, the Agent-level
callback is *not executed* (skipped).

For more information about Agent callbacks defined as part of an Agent object,
see
[Types of Callbacks](../callbacks/types-of-callbacks/#agent-lifecycle-callbacks).

### Model callbacks

Model callbacks **(`before_model`, `after_model`, `on_model_error`)** happen
before and after a Model object executes. The Plugins feature also supports a
callback in the event of an error, as detailed below:

-   If an agent needs to call an AI model, `before_model_callback` runs first.
-   If the model call is successful, `after_model_callback` runs next.
-   If the model call fails with an exception, the `on_model_error_callback`
    is triggered instead, allowing for graceful recovery.

**Caution:** Plugins that implement the **`before_model`** and  `**after_model`
**callback methods are executed *before* the Model-level callbacks are executed.
Furthermore, if a Plugin-level model callback returns anything other than a
`None` or null response, the Model-level callback is *not executed* (skipped).

#### Model on error callback details

The on error callback for Model objects is only supported by the Plugins
feature works as follows:

-   **When It Runs:** When an exception is raised during the model call.
-   **Common Use Cases:** Graceful error handling, logging the specific
    error, or returning a fallback response, such as "The AI service is
    currently unavailable."
-   **Flow Control:**
    -   Returns an `LlmResponse` object to **suppress the exception**
        and provide a fallback result.
    -   Returns `None` to allow the original exception to be raised.

**Note**: If the execution of the Model object returns a `LlmResponse`, the
system resumes the execution flow, and `after_model_callback` will be triggered
normally.****

The following code example shows the basic syntax of this callback:

```py
async def on_model_error_callback(
    self,
    *,
    callback_context: CallbackContext,
    llm_request: LlmRequest,
    error: Exception,
) -> Optional[LlmResponse]:
```

### Tool callbacks

Tool callbacks **(`before_tool`, `after_tool`, `on_tool_error`)** for Plugins
happen before or after the execution of a tool, or when an error occurs. The
Plugins feature also supports a callback in the event of an error, as detailed
below:\

-   When an agent executes a Tool, `before_tool_callback` runs first.
-   If the tool executes successfully, `after_tool_callback` runs next.
-   If the tool raises an exception, the `on_tool_error_callback` is
    triggered instead, giving you a chance to handle the failure. If
    `on_tool_error_callback` returns a dict, `after_tool_callback` will be
    triggered normally.

**Caution:** Plugins that implement these callbacks are executed *before* the
Tool-level callbacks are executed. Furthermore, if a Plugin-level tool callback
returns anything other than a `None` or null response, the Tool-level callback
is *not executed* (skipped).

#### Tool on error callback details

The on error callback for Tool objects is only supported by the Plugins feature
works as follows:

-   **When It Runs:** When an exception is raised during the execution of a
    tool's `run` method.
-   **Purpose:** Catching specific tool exceptions (like `APIError`),
    logging the failure, and providing a user-friendly error message back to
    the LLM.
-   **Flow Control:** Return a `dict` to **suppress the exception**, provide
    a fallback result. Return `None` to allow the original exception to be raised.

**Note**: By returning a `dict`, this resumes the execution flow, and
`after_tool_callback` will be triggered normally.

The following code example shows the basic syntax of this callback:

```py
async def on_tool_error_callback(
    self,
    *,
    tool: BaseTool,
    tool_args: dict[str, Any],
    tool_context: ToolContext,
    error: Exception,
) -> Optional[dict]:
```

### Event callbacks

An *Event callback* (`on_event_callback`) happens when an agent produces
outputs such as a text response or a tool call result, it yields them as `Event`
objects. The `on_event_callback` fires for each event, allowing you to modify it
before it's streamed to the client.

-   **When It Runs:** After an agent yields an `Event` but before it's sent
    to the user. An agent's run may produce multiple events.
-   **Purpose:** Useful for modifying or enriching events (e.g., adding
    metadata) or for triggering side effects based on specific events.
-   **Flow Control:** Return an `Event` object to **replace** the original
    event.

The following code example shows the basic syntax of this callback:

```py
async def on_event_callback(
    self, *, invocation_context: InvocationContext, event: Event
) -> Optional[Event]:
```

### Runner end callbacks

The *Runner end* callback **(`after_run_callback`)** happens when the agent has
finished its entire process and all events have been handled, the `Runner`
completes its run. The `after_run_callback` is the final hook, perfect for
cleanup and final reporting.

-   **When It Runs:** After the `Runner` fully completes the execution of a
    request.
-   **Purpose:** Ideal for global cleanup tasks, such as closing connections
    or finalizing logs and metrics data.
-   **Flow Control:** This callback is for teardown only and cannot alter
    the final result.

The following code example shows the basic syntax of this callback:

```py
async def after_run_callback(
    self, *, invocation_context: InvocationContext
) -> Optional[None]:
```

# Runtime

## What is runtime?

The ADK Runtime is the underlying engine that powers your agent application during user interactions. It's the system that takes your defined agents, tools, and callbacks and orchestrates their execution in response to user input, managing the flow of information, state changes, and interactions with external services like LLMs or storage.

Think of the Runtime as the **"engine"** of your agentic application. You define the parts (agents, tools), and the Runtime handles how they connect and run together to fulfill a user's request.

## Core Idea: The Event Loop

At its heart, the ADK Runtime operates on an **Event Loop**. This loop facilitates a back-and-forth communication between the `Runner` component and your defined "Execution Logic" (which includes your Agents, the LLM calls they make, Callbacks, and Tools).

![intro_components.png](../assets/event-loop.png)

In simple terms:

1. The `Runner` receives a user query and asks the main `Agent` to start processing.
2. The `Agent` (and its associated logic) runs until it has something to report (like a response, a request to use a tool, or a state change) – it then **yields** or **emits** an `Event`.
3. The `Runner` receives this `Event`, processes any associated actions (like saving state changes via `Services`), and forwards the event onwards (e.g., to the user interface).
4. Only *after* the `Runner` has processed the event does the `Agent`'s logic **resume** from where it paused, now potentially seeing the effects of the changes committed by the Runner.
5. This cycle repeats until the agent has no more events to yield for the current user query.

This event-driven loop is the fundamental pattern governing how ADK executes your agent code.

## The Heartbeat: The Event Loop - Inner workings

The Event Loop is the core operational pattern defining the interaction between the `Runner` and your custom code (Agents, Tools, Callbacks, collectively referred to as "Execution Logic" or "Logic Components" in the design document). It establishes a clear division of responsibilities:

!!! Note
    The specific method names and parameter names may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `agent_to_run.runAsync(...)` in Java, `agent_to_run.run_async(...)` in Python). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Runner's Role (Orchestrator)

The `Runner` acts as the central coordinator for a single user invocation. Its responsibilities in the loop are:

1. **Initiation:** Receives the end user's query (`new_message`) and typically appends it to the session history via the `SessionService`.
2. **Kick-off:** Starts the event generation process by calling the main agent's execution method (e.g., `agent_to_run.run_async(...)`).
3. **Receive & Process:** Waits for the agent logic to `yield` or `emit` an `Event`. Upon receiving an event, the Runner **promptly processes** it. This involves:
      * Using configured `Services` (`SessionService`, `ArtifactService`, `MemoryService`) to commit changes indicated in `event.actions` (like `state_delta`, `artifact_delta`).
      * Performing other internal bookkeeping.
4. **Yield Upstream:** Forwards the processed event onwards (e.g., to the calling application or UI for rendering).
5. **Iterate:** Signals the agent logic that processing is complete for the yielded event, allowing it to resume and generate the *next* event.

*Conceptual Runner Loop:*

=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Simplified view of Runner's main loop logic
    def run(new_query, ...) -> Generator[Event]:
        # 1. Append new_query to session event history (via SessionService)
        session_service.append_event(session, Event(author='user', content=new_query))
    
        # 2. Kick off event loop by calling the agent
        agent_event_generator = agent_to_run.run_async(context)
    
        async for event in agent_event_generator:
            # 3. Process the generated event and commit changes
            session_service.append_event(session, event) # Commits state/artifact deltas etc.

            # artifact_service might have already been called via context during agent run
    
            # 4. Yield event for upstream processing (e.g., UI rendering)
            yield event
            # Runner implicitly signals agent generator can continue after yielding
    ```

    // Simplified conceptual view of the Runner's main loop logic in Java.
    public Flowable<Event> runConceptual(
        Session session,                  
        InvocationContext invocationContext, 
        Content newQuery                
        ) {
    
        // 1. Append new_query to session event history (via SessionService)

        Flowable<Event> agentEventStream = agentToRun.runAsync(invocationContext);
    
        // 3. Process each generated event, commit changes, and "yield" or "emit"
        return agentEventStream.map(event -> {
            // This mutates the session object (adds event, applies stateDelta).
            // The return value of appendEvent (a Single<Event>) is conceptually
            // just the event itself after processing.
            sessionService.appendEvent(session, event).blockingGet(); // Simplified blocking call
    
            // memory_service.update_memory(...) // If applicable - conceptual
            // artifact_service might have already been called via context during agent run
    
            // 4. "Yield" event for upstream processing
            //    In RxJava, returning the event in map effectively yields it to the next operator or subscriber.
            return event;
        });
    }
    ```

### Execution Logic's Role (Agent, Tool, Callback)

Your code within agents, tools, and callbacks is responsible for the actual computation and decision-making. Its interaction with the loop involves:

1. **Execute:** Runs its logic based on the current `InvocationContext`, including the session state *as it was when execution resumed*.
2. **Yield:** When the logic needs to communicate (send a message, call a tool, report a state change), it constructs an `Event` containing the relevant content and actions, and then `yield`s this event back to the `Runner`.
3. **Pause:** Crucially, execution of the agent logic **pauses immediately** after the `yield` statement (or `return` in RxJava). It waits for the `Runner` to complete step 3 (processing and committing).
4. **Resume:** *Only after* the `Runner` has processed the yielded event does the agent logic resume execution from the statement immediately following the `yield`.
5. **See Updated State:** Upon resumption, the agent logic can now reliably access the session state (`ctx.session.state`) reflecting the changes that were committed by the `Runner` from the *previously yielded* event.

*Conceptual Execution Logic:*

=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Simplified view of logic inside Agent.run_async, callbacks, or tools
    
    # ... previous code runs based on current state ...
    
    # 1. Determine a change or output is needed, construct the event
    # Example: Updating state
    update_data = {'field_1': 'value_2'}
    event_with_state_change = Event(
        author=self.name,
        actions=EventActions(state_delta=update_data),
        content=types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text="State updated.")])
        # ... other event fields ...
    )
    
    # 2. Yield the event to the Runner for processing & commit
    yield event_with_state_change
    # <<<<<<<<<<<< EXECUTION PAUSES HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>
    
    # <<<<<<<<<<<< RUNNER PROCESSES & COMMITS THE EVENT >>>>>>>>>>>>
    
    # 3. Resume execution ONLY after Runner is done processing the above event.
    # Now, the state committed by the Runner is reliably reflected.
    # Subsequent code can safely assume the change from the yielded event happened.
    val = ctx.session.state['field_1']
    # here `val` is guaranteed to be "value_2" (assuming Runner committed successfully)
    print(f"Resumed execution. Value of field_1 is now: {val}")
    
    # ... subsequent code continues ...
    # Maybe yield another event later...
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Simplified view of logic inside Agent.runAsync, callbacks, or tools
    // ... previous code runs based on current state ...
    
    // 1. Determine a change or output is needed, construct the event
    // Example: Updating state
    ConcurrentMap<String, Object> updateData = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    updateData.put("field_1", "value_2");
    
    EventActions actions = EventActions.builder().stateDelta(updateData).build();
    Content eventContent = Content.builder().parts(Part.fromText("State updated.")).build();
    
    Event eventWithStateChange = Event.builder()
        .author(self.name())
        .actions(actions)
        .content(Optional.of(eventContent))
        // ... other event fields ...
        .build();
    
    // 2. "Yield" the event. In RxJava, this means emitting it into the stream.
    //    The Runner (or upstream consumer) will subscribe to this Flowable.
    //    When the Runner receives this event, it will process it (e.g., call sessionService.appendEvent).
    //    The 'appendEvent' in Java ADK mutates the 'Session' object held within 'ctx' (InvocationContext).
    
    // <<<<<<<<<<<< CONCEPTUAL PAUSE POINT >>>>>>>>>>>>
    // In RxJava, the emission of 'eventWithStateChange' happens, and then the stream
    // might continue with a 'flatMap' or 'concatMap' operator that represents
    // the logic *after* the Runner has processed this event.
    
    // To model the "resume execution ONLY after Runner is done processing":
    // The Runner's `appendEvent` is usually an async operation itself (returns Single<Event>).
    // The agent's flow needs to be structured such that subsequent logic
    // that depends on the committed state runs *after* that `appendEvent` completes.
    
    // This is how the Runner typically orchestrates it:
    // Runner:
    //   agent.runAsync(ctx)
    //     .concatMapEager(eventFromAgent ->
    //         sessionService.appendEvent(ctx.session(), eventFromAgent) // This updates ctx.session().state()
    //             .toFlowable() // Emits the event after it's processed
    //     )
    //     .subscribe(processedEvent -> { /* UI renders processedEvent */ });
    
    // So, within the agent's own logic, if it needs to do something *after* an event it yielded
    // has been processed and its state changes are reflected in ctx.session().state(),
    // that subsequent logic would typically be in another step of its reactive chain.
    
    // For this conceptual example, we'll emit the event, and then simulate the "resume"
    // as a subsequent operation in the Flowable chain.
    
    return Flowable.just(eventWithStateChange) // Step 2: Yield the event
        .concatMap(yieldedEvent -> {
            // <<<<<<<<<<<< RUNNER CONCEPTUALLY PROCESSES & COMMITS THE EVENT >>>>>>>>>>>>
            // At this point, in a real runner, ctx.session().appendEvent(yieldedEvent) would have been called
            // by the Runner, and ctx.session().state() would be updated.
            // Since we are *inside* the agent's conceptual logic trying to model this,
            // we assume the Runner's action has implicitly updated our 'ctx.session()'.
    
            // 3. Resume execution.
            // Now, the state committed by the Runner (via sessionService.appendEvent)
            // is reliably reflected in ctx.session().state().
            Object val = ctx.session().state().get("field_1");
            // here `val` is guaranteed to be "value_2" because the `sessionService.appendEvent`
            // called by the Runner would have updated the session state within the `ctx` object.
    
            System.out.println("Resumed execution. Value of field_1 is now: " + val);
    
            // ... subsequent code continues ...
            // If this subsequent code needs to yield another event, it would do so here.
    ```

This cooperative yield/pause/resume cycle between the `Runner` and your Execution Logic, mediated by `Event` objects, forms the core of the ADK Runtime.

## Key components of the Runtime

Several components work together within the ADK Runtime to execute an agent invocation. Understanding their roles clarifies how the event loop functions:

1. ### `Runner`

      * **Role:** The main entry point and orchestrator for a single user query (`run_async`).
      * **Function:** Manages the overall Event Loop, receives events yielded by the Execution Logic, coordinates with Services to process and commit event actions (state/artifact changes), and forwards processed events upstream (e.g., to the UI). It essentially drives the conversation turn by turn based on yielded events. (Defined in `google.adk.runners.runner`).

2. ### Execution Logic Components

      * **Role:** The parts containing your custom code and the core agent capabilities.
      * **Components:**
      * `Agent` (`BaseAgent`, `LlmAgent`, etc.): Your primary logic units that process information and decide on actions. They implement the `_run_async_impl` method which yields events.
      * `Tools` (`BaseTool`, `FunctionTool`, `AgentTool`, etc.): External functions or capabilities used by agents (often `LlmAgent`) to interact with the outside world or perform specific tasks. They execute and return results, which are then wrapped in events.
      * `Callbacks` (Functions): User-defined functions attached to agents (e.g., `before_agent_callback`, `after_model_callback`) that hook into specific points in the execution flow, potentially modifying behavior or state, whose effects are captured in events.
      * **Function:** Perform the actual thinking, calculation, or external interaction. They communicate their results or needs by **yielding `Event` objects** and pausing until the Runner processes them.

3. ### `Event`

      * **Role:** The message passed back and forth between the `Runner` and the Execution Logic.
      * **Function:** Represents an atomic occurrence (user input, agent text, tool call/result, state change request, control signal). It carries both the content of the occurrence and the intended side effects (`actions` like `state_delta`).

4. ### `Services`

      * **Role:** Backend components responsible for managing persistent or shared resources. Used primarily by the `Runner` during event processing.
      * **Components:**
      * `SessionService` (`BaseSessionService`, `InMemorySessionService`, etc.): Manages `Session` objects, including saving/loading them, applying `state_delta` to the session state, and appending events to the `event history`.
      * `ArtifactService` (`BaseArtifactService`, `InMemoryArtifactService`, `GcsArtifactService`, etc.): Manages the storage and retrieval of binary artifact data. Although `save_artifact` is called via context during execution logic, the `artifact_delta` in the event confirms the action for the Runner/SessionService.
      * `MemoryService` (`BaseMemoryService`, etc.): (Optional) Manages long-term semantic memory across sessions for a user.
      * **Function:** Provide the persistence layer. The `Runner` interacts with them to ensure changes signaled by `event.actions` are reliably stored *before* the Execution Logic resumes.

5. ### `Session`

      * **Role:** A data container holding the state and history for *one specific conversation* between a user and the application.
      * **Function:** Stores the current `state` dictionary, the list of all past `events` (`event history`), and references to associated artifacts. It's the primary record of the interaction, managed by the `SessionService`.

6. ### `Invocation`

      * **Role:** A conceptual term representing everything that happens in response to a *single* user query, from the moment the `Runner` receives it until the agent logic finishes yielding events for that query.
      * **Function:** An invocation might involve multiple agent runs (if using agent transfer or `AgentTool`), multiple LLM calls, tool executions, and callback executions, all tied together by a single `invocation_id` within the `InvocationContext`. State variables prefixed with `temp:` are strictly scoped to a single invocation and discarded afterwards.

These players interact continuously through the Event Loop to process a user's request.

## How It Works: A Simplified Invocation

Let's trace a simplified flow for a typical user query that involves an LLM agent calling a tool:

![intro_components.png](../assets/invocation-flow.png)

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **User Input:** The User sends a query (e.g., "What's the capital of France?").
2. **Runner Starts:** `Runner.run_async` begins. It interacts with the `SessionService` to load the relevant `Session` and adds the user query as the first `Event` to the session history. An `InvocationContext` (`ctx`) is prepared.
3. **Agent Execution:** The `Runner` calls `agent.run_async(ctx)` on the designated root agent (e.g., an `LlmAgent`).
4. **LLM Call (Example):** The `Agent_Llm` determines it needs information, perhaps by calling a tool. It prepares a request for the `LLM`. Let's assume the LLM decides to call `MyTool`.
5. **Yield FunctionCall Event:** The `Agent_Llm` receives the `FunctionCall` response from the LLM, wraps it in an `Event(author='Agent_Llm', content=Content(parts=[Part(function_call=...)]))`, and `yields` or `emits` this event.
6. **Agent Pauses:** The `Agent_Llm`'s execution pauses immediately after the `yield`.
7. **Runner Processes:** The `Runner` receives the FunctionCall event. It passes it to the `SessionService` to record it in the history. The `Runner` then yields the event upstream to the `User` (or application).
8. **Agent Resumes:** The `Runner` signals that the event is processed, and `Agent_Llm` resumes execution.
9. **Tool Execution:** The `Agent_Llm`'s internal flow now proceeds to execute the requested `MyTool`. It calls `tool.run_async(...)`.
10. **Tool Returns Result:** `MyTool` executes and returns its result (e.g., `{'result': 'Paris'}`).
11. **Yield FunctionResponse Event:** The agent (`Agent_Llm`) wraps the tool result into an `Event` containing a `FunctionResponse` part (e.g., `Event(author='Agent_Llm', content=Content(role='user', parts=[Part(function_response=...)]))`). This event might also contain `actions` if the tool modified state (`state_delta`) or saved artifacts (`artifact_delta`). The agent `yield`s this event.
12. **Agent Pauses:** `Agent_Llm` pauses again.
13. **Runner Processes:** `Runner` receives the FunctionResponse event. It passes it to `SessionService` which applies any `state_delta`/`artifact_delta` and adds the event to history. `Runner` yields the event upstream.
14. **Agent Resumes:** `Agent_Llm` resumes, now knowing the tool result and any state changes are committed.
15. **Final LLM Call (Example):** `Agent_Llm` sends the tool result back to the `LLM` to generate a natural language response.
16. **Yield Final Text Event:** `Agent_Llm` receives the final text from the `LLM`, wraps it in an `Event(author='Agent_Llm', content=Content(parts=[Part(text=...)]))`, and `yield`s it.
17. **Agent Pauses:** `Agent_Llm` pauses.
18. **Runner Processes:** `Runner` receives the final text event, passes it to `SessionService` for history, and yields it upstream to the `User`. This is likely marked as the `is_final_response()`.
19. **Agent Resumes & Finishes:** `Agent_Llm` resumes. Having completed its task for this invocation, its `run_async` generator finishes.
20. **Runner Completes:** The `Runner` sees the agent's generator is exhausted and finishes its loop for this invocation.

This yield/pause/process/resume cycle ensures that state changes are consistently applied and that the execution logic always operates on the most recently committed state after yielding an event.

## Important Runtime Behaviors

Understanding a few key aspects of how the ADK Runtime handles state, streaming, and asynchronous operations is crucial for building predictable and efficient agents.

### State Updates & Commitment Timing

* **The Rule:** When your code (in an agent, tool, or callback) modifies the session state (e.g., `context.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`), this change is initially recorded locally within the current `InvocationContext`. The change is only **guaranteed to be persisted** (saved by the `SessionService`) *after* the `Event` carrying the corresponding `state_delta` in its `actions` has been `yield`\-ed by your code and subsequently processed by the `Runner`.

* **Implication:** Code that runs *after* resuming from a `yield` can reliably assume that the state changes signaled in the *yielded event* have been committed.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Inside agent logic (conceptual)
    
    # 1. Modify state
    ctx.session.state['status'] = 'processing'
    event1 = Event(..., actions=EventActions(state_delta={'status': 'processing'}))
    
    # 2. Yield event with the delta
    yield event1
    # --- PAUSE --- Runner processes event1, SessionService commits 'status' = 'processing' ---
    
    # 3. Resume execution
    # Now it's safe to rely on the committed state
    current_status = ctx.session.state['status'] # Guaranteed to be 'processing'
    print(f"Status after resuming: {current_status}")
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Inside agent logic (conceptual)
    // ... previous code runs based on current state ...
    
    // 1. Prepare state modification and construct the event
    ConcurrentHashMap<String, Object> stateChanges = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    stateChanges.put("status", "processing");
    
    EventActions actions = EventActions.builder().stateDelta(stateChanges).build();
    Content content = Content.builder().parts(Part.fromText("Status update: processing")).build();
    
    Event event1 = Event.builder()
        .actions(actions)
        // ...
        .build();
    
    // 2. Yield event with the delta
    return Flowable.just(event1)
        .map(
            emittedEvent -> {
                // --- CONCEPTUAL PAUSE & RUNNER PROCESSING ---
                // 3. Resume execution (conceptually)
                // Now it's safe to rely on the committed state.
                String currentStatus = (String) ctx.session().state().get("status");
                System.out.println("Status after resuming (inside agent logic): " + currentStatus); // Guaranteed to be 'processing'
    
                // The event itself (event1) is passed on.
                // If subsequent logic within this agent step produced *another* event,
                // you'd use concatMap to emit that new event.
                return emittedEvent;
            });
    
    // ... subsequent agent logic might involve further reactive operators
    // or emitting more events based on the now-updated `ctx.session().state()`.
    ```

### "Dirty Reads" of Session State

* **Definition:** While commitment happens *after* the yield, code running *later within the same invocation*, but *before* the state-changing event is actually yielded and processed, **can often see the local, uncommitted changes**. This is sometimes called a "dirty read".
* **Example:**

=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Code in before_agent_callback
    callback_context.state['field_1'] = 'value_1'
    # State is locally set to 'value_1', but not yet committed by Runner
    
    # ... agent runs ...
    
    # Code in a tool called later *within the same invocation*
    # Readable (dirty read), but 'value_1' isn't guaranteed persistent yet.
    val = tool_context.state['field_1'] # 'val' will likely be 'value_1' here
    print(f"Dirty read value in tool: {val}")
    
    # Assume the event carrying the state_delta={'field_1': 'value_1'}
    # is yielded *after* this tool runs and is processed by the Runner.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Modify state - Code in BeforeAgentCallback
    // AND stages this change in callbackContext.eventActions().stateDelta().
    callbackContext.state().put("field_1", "value_1");

    // --- agent runs ... ---

    // --- Code in a tool called later *within the same invocation* ---
    // Readable (dirty read), but 'value_1' isn't guaranteed persistent yet.
    Object val = toolContext.state().get("field_1"); // 'val' will likely be 'value_1' here
    System.out.println("Dirty read value in tool: " + val);
    // Assume the event carrying the state_delta={'field_1': 'value_1'}
    // is yielded *after* this tool runs and is processed by the Runner.
    ```

* **Implications:**
  * **Benefit:** Allows different parts of your logic within a single complex step (e.g., multiple callbacks or tool calls before the next LLM turn) to coordinate using state without waiting for a full yield/commit cycle.
  * **Caveat:** Relying heavily on dirty reads for critical logic can be risky. If the invocation fails *before* the event carrying the `state_delta` is yielded and processed by the `Runner`, the uncommitted state change will be lost. For critical state transitions, ensure they are associated with an event that gets successfully processed.

### Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Output (`partial=True`)

This primarily relates to how responses from the LLM are handled, especially when using streaming generation APIs.

* **Streaming:** The LLM generates its response token-by-token or in small chunks.
  * The framework (often within `BaseLlmFlow`) yields multiple `Event` objects for a single conceptual response. Most of these events will have `partial=True`.
  * The `Runner`, upon receiving an event with `partial=True`, typically **forwards it immediately** upstream (for UI display) but **skips processing its `actions`** (like `state_delta`).
  * Eventually, the framework yields a final event for that response, marked as non-partial (`partial=False` or implicitly via `turn_complete=True`).
  * The `Runner` **fully processes only this final event**, committing any associated `state_delta` or `artifact_delta`.
* **Non-Streaming:** The LLM generates the entire response at once. The framework yields a single event marked as non-partial, which the `Runner` processes fully.
* **Why it Matters:** Ensures that state changes are applied atomically and only once based on the *complete* response from the LLM, while still allowing the UI to display text progressively as it's generated.

## Async is Primary (`run_async`)

* **Core Design:** The ADK Runtime is fundamentally built on asynchronous libraries (like Python's `asyncio` and Java's `RxJava`) to handle concurrent operations (like waiting for LLM responses or tool executions) efficiently without blocking.
* **Main Entry Point:** `Runner.run_async` is the primary method for executing agent invocations. All core runnable components (Agents, specific flows) use `asynchronous` methods internally.
* **Synchronous Convenience (`run`):** A synchronous `Runner.run` method exists mainly for convenience (e.g., in simple scripts or testing environments). However, internally, `Runner.run` typically just calls `Runner.run_async` and manages the async event loop execution for you.
* **Developer Experience:** We recommend designing your applications (e.g., web servers using ADK) to be asynchronous for best performance. In Python, this means using `asyncio`; in Java, leverage `RxJava`'s reactive programming model.
* **Sync Callbacks/Tools:** The ADK framework supports both asynchronous and synchronous functions for tools and callbacks.
    * **Blocking I/O:** For long-running synchronous I/O operations, the framework attempts to prevent stalls. Python ADK may use asyncio.to_thread, while Java ADK often relies on appropriate RxJava schedulers or wrappers for blocking calls.
    * **CPU-Bound Work:** Purely CPU-intensive synchronous tasks will still block their execution thread in both environments.

Understanding these behaviors helps you write more robust ADK applications and debug issues related to state consistency, streaming updates, and asynchronous execution.

# Resume stopped agents

An ADK agent's execution can be interrupted by various factors including
dropped network connections, power failure, or a required external system going
offline. The Resume feature of ADK allows an agent workflow to pick up where it
left off, avoiding the need to restart the entire workflow. In ADK Python 1.16
and higher, you can configure an ADK workflow to be resumable, so that it tracks
the execution of workflow and then allows you to resume it after an unexpected
interruption.

This guide explains how to configure your ADK agent workflow to be resumable.
If you use Custom Agents, you can update them to be resumable. For more
information, see 
[Add resume to custom Agents](#custom-agents).

## Add resumable configuration

Enable the Resume function for an agent workflow by applying a Resumabiltiy
configuration to the App object of your ADK workflow, as shown in the following
code example:

```python
app = App(
    name='my_resumable_agent',
    root_agent=root_agent,
    # Set the resumability config to enable resumability.
    resumability_config=ResumabilityConfig(
        is_resumable=True,
    ),
)
```

!!! warning "Caution: Long Running Functions, Confirmations, Authentication"
    For agents that use
    [Long Running Functions](/adk-docs/tools/function-tools/#long-run-tool),
    [Confirmations](/adk-docs/tools/confirmation/), or
    [Authentication](/adk-docs/tools/authentication/)
    requiring user input, adding a resumable confirmation changes how these features
    operate. For more information, see the documentation for those features.

!!! info "Note: Custom Agents"
    Resume is not supported by default for Custom Agents. You must
    update the agent code for a Custom Agent to support the Resume feature. For
    information on modifying Custom Agents to support incremental resume
    functionality, see 
    [Add resume to custom Agents](#custom-agents).

## Resume a stopped workflow

When an ADK workflow stops execution you can resume the workflow using a
command containing the Invocation ID for the workflow instance, which can be
found in the
[Event](/adk-docs/events/#understanding-and-using-events)
history of the workflow. Make sure the ADK API server is running, in case it was
interrupted or powered off, and then run the following command to resume the
workflow, as shown in the following API request example.

```console
# restart the API server if needed:
adk api_server my_resumable_agent/

# resume the agent:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
   "app_name": "my_resumable_agent",
   "user_id": "u_123",
   "session_id": "s_abc",
   "invocation_id": "invocation-123",
 }'
```

You can also resume a workflow using the Runner object Run Async method, as
shown below:

```python
runner.run_async(user_id='u_123', session_id='s_abc', 
    invocation_id='invocation-123')

# When new_message is set to a function response,
# we are trying to resume a long running function.
```

!!! info "Note"
    Resuming a workflow from the ADK Web user interface or using the ADK
    command line (CLI) tool is not currently supported.

## How it works

The Resume feature works by logging completed Agent workflow tasks,
including incremental steps using
[Events](/adk-docs/events/) and
[Event Actions](/adk-docs/events/#detecting-actions-and-side-effects).
tracking completion of agent tasks within a resumable workflow. If a workflow is
interrupted and then later restarted, the system resumes the workflow by setting
the completion state of each agent. If an agent did not complete, the workflow
system reinstates any completed Events for that agent, and restarts the workflow
from the partially completed state. For multi-agent workflows, the specific
resume behavior varies, based on the multi-agent classes in your workflow, as
described below:

-   **Sequential Agent**: Reads the current_sub_agent from its saved state
    to find the next sub-agent to run in the sequence.
-   **Loop Agent**: Uses the current_sub_agent and times_looped values to
    continue the loop from the last completed iteration and sub-agent.
-   **Parallel Agent**: Determines which sub-agents have already completed
    and only runs those that have not finished.

Event logging includes results from Tools which successfully returned a result.
So if an agent successfully executed Function Tools A and B, and then failed
during execution of tool C, the system reinstates the results from the
tools A and B, and resumes the workflow by re-running the tool C request.

!!! warning "Caution: Tool execution behavior"
    When resuming a workflow with Tools, the Resume feature ensures
    that the Tools in an agent are run ***at least once***, and may run more than
    once when resuming a workflow. If your agent uses Tools where duplicate runs
    would have a negative impact, such as purchases, you should modify the Tool to
    check for and prevent duplicate runs.

!!! note "Note: Workflow modification with Resume not supported"
    Do not modify a stopped agent workflow before resuming it. 
    For example adding or removing agents from workflow that has stopped
    and then resuming that workflow is not supported.

## Add resume to custom Agents {#custom-agents}

Custom agents have specific implementation requirements in order to support
resumability. You must decide on and define workflow steps within your custom
agent which produce a result which can be preserved before handing off to the
next step of processing. The following steps outline how to modify a Custom
Agent to support a workflow Resume.

-   **Create CustomAgentState class**: Extend the BaseAgentState to create
    an object that preserves the state of your agent.
    -   **Optionally, create WorkFlowStep class**: If your custom agent
        has sequential steps, consider creating a WorkFlowStep list object that
        defines the discrete, savable steps of the agent.
-   **Add initial agent state:** Modify your agent's async run function to
    set the initial state of your agent.
-   **Add agent state checkpoints**: Modify your agent's async run function
    to generate and save the agent state for each completed step of the agent's
    overall task.
-   **Add end of agent status to track agent state:** Modify your agent's
    async run function to include an `end_of_agent=True` status upon successful
    completion of the agent's full task.

The following example shows the required code modifications to the example
StoryFlowAgent class shown in the

# Runtime Configuration

`RunConfig` defines runtime behavior and options for agents in the ADK. It
controls speech and streaming settings, function calling, artifact saving, and
limits on LLM calls.

When constructing an agent run, you can pass a `RunConfig` to customize how the
agent interacts with models, handles audio, and streams responses. By default,
no streaming is enabled and inputs aren’t retained as artifacts. Use `RunConfig`
to override these defaults.

## Class Definition

The `RunConfig` class holds configuration parameters for an agent's runtime behavior.

- Python ADK uses Pydantic for this validation.

- Java ADK typically uses immutable data classes.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    class RunConfig(BaseModel):
        """Configs for runtime behavior of agents."""
    
        model_config = ConfigDict(
            extra='forbid',
        )
    
        speech_config: Optional[types.SpeechConfig] = None
        response_modalities: Optional[list[str]] = None
        save_input_blobs_as_artifacts: bool = False
        support_cfc: bool = False
        streaming_mode: StreamingMode = StreamingMode.NONE
        output_audio_transcription: Optional[types.AudioTranscriptionConfig] = None
        max_llm_calls: int = 500
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    public abstract class RunConfig {
      
      public enum StreamingMode {
        NONE,
        SSE,
        BIDI
      }
      
      public abstract @Nullable SpeechConfig speechConfig();
    
      public abstract ImmutableList<Modality> responseModalities();
    
      public abstract boolean saveInputBlobsAsArtifacts();
      
      public abstract @Nullable AudioTranscriptionConfig outputAudioTranscription();
    
      public abstract int maxLlmCalls();
      
      // ...
    }
    ```

### `speech_config`

!!! Note
    The interface or definition of `SpeechConfig` is the same, irrespective of the language.

Speech configuration settings for live agents with audio capabilities. The
`SpeechConfig` class has the following structure:

```python
class SpeechConfig(_common.BaseModel):
    """The speech generation configuration."""

    voice_config: Optional[VoiceConfig] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="""The configuration for the speaker to use.""",
    )
    language_code: Optional[str] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="""Language code (ISO 639. e.g. en-US) for the speech synthesization.
        Only available for Live API.""",
    )
```

The `voice_config` parameter uses the `VoiceConfig` class:

```python
class VoiceConfig(_common.BaseModel):
    """The configuration for the voice to use."""

    prebuilt_voice_config: Optional[PrebuiltVoiceConfig] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="""The configuration for the speaker to use.""",
    )
```

And `PrebuiltVoiceConfig` has the following structure:

```python
class PrebuiltVoiceConfig(_common.BaseModel):
    """The configuration for the prebuilt speaker to use."""

    voice_name: Optional[str] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="""The name of the prebuilt voice to use.""",
    )
```

These nested configuration classes allow you to specify:

* `voice_config`: The name of the prebuilt voice to use (in the `PrebuiltVoiceConfig`)
* `language_code`: ISO 639 language code (e.g., "en-US") for speech synthesis

When implementing voice-enabled agents, configure these parameters to control
how your agent sounds when speaking.

### `response_modalities`

Defines the output modalities for the agent. If not set, defaults to AUDIO.
Response modalities determine how the agent communicates with users through
various channels (e.g., text, audio).

### `save_input_blobs_as_artifacts`

When enabled, input blobs will be saved as artifacts during agent execution.
This is useful for debugging and audit purposes, allowing developers to review
the exact data received by agents.

### `support_cfc`

Enables Compositional Function Calling (CFC) support. Only applicable when using
StreamingMode.SSE. When enabled, the LIVE API will be invoked as only it
supports CFC functionality.

!!! warning

    The `support_cfc` feature is experimental and its API or behavior might
    change in future releases.

### `streaming_mode`

Configures the streaming behavior of the agent. Possible values:

* `StreamingMode.NONE`: No streaming; responses delivered as complete units
* `StreamingMode.SSE`: Server-Sent Events streaming; one-way streaming from server to client
* `StreamingMode.BIDI`: Bidirectional streaming; simultaneous communication in both directions

Streaming modes affect both performance and user experience. SSE streaming lets users see partial responses as they're generated, while BIDI streaming enables real-time interactive experiences.

### `output_audio_transcription`

Configuration for transcribing audio outputs from live agents with audio
response capability. This enables automatic transcription of audio responses for
accessibility, record-keeping, and multi-modal applications.

### `max_llm_calls`

Sets a limit on the total number of LLM calls for a given agent run.

* Values greater than 0 and less than `sys.maxsize`: Enforces a bound on LLM calls
* Values less than or equal to 0: Allows unbounded LLM calls *(not recommended for production)*

This parameter prevents excessive API usage and potential runaway processes.
Since LLM calls often incur costs and consume resources, setting appropriate
limits is crucial.

## Validation Rules

The `RunConfig` class validates its parameters to ensure proper agent operation. While Python ADK uses `Pydantic` for automatic type validation, Java ADK relies on its static typing and may include explicit checks in the RunConfig's construction.
For the `max_llm_calls` parameter specifically:

1. Extremely large values (like `sys.maxsize` in Python or `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in Java) are typically disallowed to prevent issues.

2. Values of zero or less will usually trigger a warning about unlimited LLM interactions.

## Examples

### Basic runtime configuration

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.genai.adk import RunConfig, StreamingMode
    
    config = RunConfig(
        streaming_mode=StreamingMode.NONE,
        max_llm_calls=100
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig;
    import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig.StreamingMode;
    
    RunConfig config = RunConfig.builder()
            .setStreamingMode(StreamingMode.NONE)
            .setMaxLlmCalls(100)
            .build();
    ```

This configuration creates a non-streaming agent with a limit of 100 LLM calls,
suitable for simple task-oriented agents where complete responses are
preferable.

### Enabling streaming

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.genai.adk import RunConfig, StreamingMode
    
    config = RunConfig(
        streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE,
        max_llm_calls=200
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig;
    import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig.StreamingMode;
    
    RunConfig config = RunConfig.builder()
        .setStreamingMode(StreamingMode.SSE)
        .setMaxLlmCalls(200)
        .build();
    ```

Using SSE streaming allows users to see responses as they're generated,
providing a more responsive feel for chatbots and assistants.

### Enabling speech support

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.genai.adk import RunConfig, StreamingMode
    from google.genai import types
    
    config = RunConfig(
        speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
            language_code="en-US",
            voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
                prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                    voice_name="Kore"
                )
            ),
        ),
        response_modalities=["AUDIO", "TEXT"],
        save_input_blobs_as_artifacts=True,
        support_cfc=True,
        streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE,
        max_llm_calls=1000,
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig;
    import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig.StreamingMode;
    import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
    import com.google.genai.types.Content;
    import com.google.genai.types.Modality;
    import com.google.genai.types.Part;
    import com.google.genai.types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig;
    import com.google.genai.types.SpeechConfig;
    import com.google.genai.types.VoiceConfig;
    
    RunConfig runConfig =
        RunConfig.builder()
            .setStreamingMode(StreamingMode.SSE)
            .setMaxLlmCalls(1000)
            .setSaveInputBlobsAsArtifacts(true)
            .setResponseModalities(ImmutableList.of(new Modality("AUDIO"), new Modality("TEXT")))
            .setSpeechConfig(
                SpeechConfig.builder()
                    .voiceConfig(
                        VoiceConfig.builder()
                            .prebuiltVoiceConfig(
                                PrebuiltVoiceConfig.builder().voiceName("Kore").build())
                            .build())
                    .languageCode("en-US")
                    .build())
            .build();
    ```

This comprehensive example configures an agent with:

* Speech capabilities using the "Kore" voice (US English)
* Both audio and text output modalities
* Artifact saving for input blobs (useful for debugging)
* Experimental CFC support enabled **(Python only)**
* SSE streaming for responsive interaction
* A limit of 1000 LLM calls

### Enabling Experimental CFC Support

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

```python
from google.genai.adk import RunConfig, StreamingMode

config = RunConfig(
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE,
    support_cfc=True,
    max_llm_calls=150
)
```

Enabling Compositional Function Calling creates an agent that can dynamically
execute functions based on model outputs, powerful for applications requiring
complex workflows.

# Safety and Security for AI Agents

## Overview

As AI agents grow in capability, ensuring they operate safely, securely, and align with your brand values is paramount. Uncontrolled agents can pose risks, including executing misaligned or harmful actions, such as data exfiltration, and generating inappropriate content that can impact your brand’s reputation. **Sources of risk include vague instructions, model hallucination, jailbreaks and prompt injections from adversarial users, and indirect prompt injections via tool use.**

[Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/overview) provides a multi-layered approach to mitigate these risks, enabling you to build powerful *and* trustworthy agents. It offers several mechanisms to establish strict boundaries, ensuring agents only perform actions you've explicitly allowed:

1. **Identity and Authorization**: Control who the agent **acts as** by defining agent and user auth.
2. **Guardrails to screen inputs and outputs:** Control your model and tool calls precisely.

    * *In-Tool Guardrails:* Design tools defensively, using developer-set tool context to enforce policies (e.g., allowing queries only on specific tables).  
    * *Built-in Gemini Safety Features:* If using Gemini models, benefit from content filters to block harmful outputs and system Instructions to guide the model's behavior and safety guidelines  
    * *Callbacks and Plugins:* Validate model and tool calls before or after execution, checking parameters against agent state or external policies.
    * *Using Gemini as a safety guardrail:* Implement an additional safety layer using a cheap and fast model (like Gemini Flash Lite) configured via callbacks  to screen inputs and outputs.

3. **Sandboxed code execution:** Prevent model-generated code to cause security issues by sandboxing the environment  
4. **Evaluation and tracing**: Use evaluation tools to assess the quality, relevance, and correctness of the agent's final output. Use tracing to gain visibility into agent actions to analyze the steps an agent takes to reach a solution, including its choice of tools, strategies, and the efficiency of its approach.
5. **Network Controls and VPC-SC:** Confine agent activity within secure perimeters (like VPC Service Controls) to prevent data exfiltration and limit the potential impact radius.

## Safety and Security Risks

Before implementing safety measures, perform a thorough risk assessment specific to your agent's capabilities, domain, and deployment context.

***Sources*** **of risk** include:

* Ambiguous agent instructions
* Prompt injection and jailbreak attempts from adversarial users  
* Indirect prompt injections via tool use

**Risk categories** include:

* **Misalignment & goal corruption**  
    * Pursuing unintended or proxy goals that lead to harmful outcomes ("reward hacking")  
    * Misinterpreting complex or ambiguous instructions  
* **Harmful content generation, including brand safety**
    * Generating toxic, hateful, biased, sexually explicit, discriminatory, or illegal content  
    * Brand safety risks such as Using language that goes against the brand’s values or off-topic conversations  
* **Unsafe actions**  
    * Executing commands that damage systems
    * Making unauthorized purchases or financial transactions.  
    * Leaking sensitive personal data (PII)
    * Data exfiltration

## Best practices

### Identity and Authorization

The identity that a *tool* uses to perform actions on external systems is a crucial design consideration from a security perspective. Different tools in the same agent can be configured with different strategies, so care is needed when talking about the agent's configurations.

#### Agent-Auth

The **tool interacts with external systems using the agent's own identity** (e.g., a service account). The agent identity must be explicitly authorized in the external system access policies, like adding an agent's service account to a database's IAM policy for read access. Such policies constrain the agent in only performing actions that the developer intended as possible: by giving read-only permissions to a resource, no matter what the model decides, the tool will be prohibited from performing write actions.

This approach is simple to implement, and it is **appropriate for agents where all users share the same level of access.** If not all users have the same level of access, such an approach alone doesn't provide enough protection and must be complemented with other techniques below. In tool implementation, ensure that logs are created to maintain attribution of actions to users, as all agents' actions will appear as coming from the agent.

#### User Auth

The tool interacts with an external system using the **identity of the "controlling user"** (e.g., the human interacting with the frontend in a web application). In ADK, this is typically implemented using OAuth: the agent interacts with the frontend to acquire a OAuth token, and then the tool uses the token when performing external actions: the external system authorizes the action if the controlling user is authorized to perform it on its own.

User auth has the advantage that agents only perform actions that the user could have performed themselves. This greatly reduces the risk that a malicious user could abuse the agent to obtain access to additional data. However, most common implementations of delegation have a fixed set permissions to delegate (i.e., OAuth scopes). Often, such scopes are broader than the access that the agent actually requires, and the techniques below are required to further constrain agent actions.

### Guardrails to screen inputs and outputs

#### In-tool guardrails

Tools can be designed with security in mind: we can create tools that expose the actions we want the model to take and nothing else. By limiting the range of actions we provide to the agents, we can deterministically eliminate classes of rogue actions that we never want the agent to take.

In-tool guardrails is an approach to create common and re-usable tools that expose deterministic controls that can be used by developers to set limits on each tool instantiation.

This approach relies on the fact that tools receive two types of input: arguments,  which are set by the model, and [**`Tool Context`**](../tools/index.md#tool-context), which can be set deterministically by the agent developer. We can rely on the deterministically set information to validate that the model is behaving as-expected.

For example, a query tool can be designed to expect a policy to be read from the Tool Context.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Conceptual example: Setting policy data intended for tool context
    # In a real ADK app, this might be set in InvocationContext.session.state
    # or passed during tool initialization, then retrieved via ToolContext.
    
    policy = {} # Assuming policy is a dictionary
    policy['select_only'] = True
    policy['tables'] = ['mytable1', 'mytable2']
    
    # Conceptual: Storing policy where the tool can access it via ToolContext later.
    # This specific line might look different in practice.
    # For example, storing in session state:
    invocation_context.session.state["query_tool_policy"] = policy
    
    # Or maybe passing during tool init:
    query_tool = QueryTool(policy=policy)
    # For this example, we'll assume it gets stored somewhere accessible.
    ```
=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Conceptual example: Setting policy data intended for tool context
    // In a real ADK app, this might be set in InvocationContext.session.state
    // or passed during tool initialization, then retrieved via ToolContext.
    
    policy = new HashMap<String, Object>(); // Assuming policy is a Map
    policy.put("select_only", true);
    policy.put("tables", new ArrayList<>("mytable1", "mytable2"));
    
    // Conceptual: Storing policy where the tool can access it via ToolContext later.
    // This specific line might look different in practice.
    // For example, storing in session state:
    invocationContext.session().state().put("query_tool_policy", policy);
    
    // Or maybe passing during tool init:
    query_tool = QueryTool(policy);
    // For this example, we'll assume it gets stored somewhere accessible.
    ```

During the tool execution, [**`Tool Context`**](../tools/index.md#tool-context) will be passed to the tool:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    def query(query: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> str | dict:
      # Assume 'policy' is retrieved from context, e.g., via session state:
      # policy = tool_context.invocation_context.session.state.get('query_tool_policy', {})
    
      # --- Placeholder Policy Enforcement ---
      policy = tool_context.invocation_context.session.state.get('query_tool_policy', {}) # Example retrieval
      actual_tables = explainQuery(query) # Hypothetical function call
    
      if not set(actual_tables).issubset(set(policy.get('tables', []))):
        # Return an error message for the model
        allowed = ", ".join(policy.get('tables', ['(None defined)']))
        return f"Error: Query targets unauthorized tables. Allowed: {allowed}"
    
      if policy.get('select_only', False):
           if not query.strip().upper().startswith("SELECT"):
               return "Error: Policy restricts queries to SELECT statements only."
      # --- End Policy Enforcement ---
    
      print(f"Executing validated query (hypothetical): {query}")
      return {"status": "success", "results": [...]} # Example successful return
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    
    import com.google.adk.tools.ToolContext;
    import java.util.*;
    
    class ToolContextQuery {
    
      public Object query(String query, ToolContext toolContext) {

        // Assume 'policy' is retrieved from context, e.g., via session state:
        Map<String, Object> queryToolPolicy =
            toolContext.invocationContext.session().state().getOrDefault("query_tool_policy", null);
        List<String> actualTables = explainQuery(query);
    
        // --- Placeholder Policy Enforcement ---
        if (!queryToolPolicy.get("tables").containsAll(actualTables)) {
          List<String> allowedPolicyTables =
              (List<String>) queryToolPolicy.getOrDefault("tables", new ArrayList<String>());

          String allowedTablesString =
              allowedPolicyTables.isEmpty() ? "(None defined)" : String.join(", ", allowedPolicyTables);
          
          return String.format(
              "Error: Query targets unauthorized tables. Allowed: %s", allowedTablesString);
        }
    
        if (!queryToolPolicy.get("select_only")) {
          if (!query.trim().toUpperCase().startswith("SELECT")) {
            return "Error: Policy restricts queries to SELECT statements only.";
          }
        }
        // --- End Policy Enforcement ---
    
        System.out.printf("Executing validated query (hypothetical) %s:", query);
        Map<String, Object> successResult = new HashMap<>();
        successResult.put("status", "success");
        successResult.put("results", Arrays.asList("result_item1", "result_item2"));
        return successResult;
      }
    }
    ```

#### Built-in Gemini Safety Features

Gemini models come with in-built safety mechanisms that can be leveraged to improve content and brand safety.

* **Content safety filters**:  [Content filters](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/configure-safety-attributes) can help block the output of harmful content. They function independently from Gemini models as part of a layered defense against threat actors who attempt to jailbreak the model. Gemini models on Vertex AI use two types of content filters:  
* **Non-configurable safety filters** automatically block outputs containing prohibited content, such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and personally identifiable information (PII).  
* **Configurable content filters** allow you to define blocking thresholds in four harm categories (hate speech, harassment, sexually explicit, and dangerous content,) based on probability and severity scores. These filters are default off but you can configure them according to your needs.  
* **System instructions for safety**: [System instructions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/safety-system-instructions) for Gemini models in Vertex AI provide direct guidance to the model on how to behave and what type of content to generate. By providing specific instructions, you can proactively steer the model away from generating undesirable content to meet your organization’s unique needs. You can craft system instructions to define content safety guidelines, such as prohibited and sensitive topics, and disclaimer language, as well as brand safety guidelines to ensure the model's outputs align with your brand's voice, tone, values, and target audience.

While these measures are robust against content safety, you need additional checks to reduce agent misalignment, unsafe actions, and brand safety risks.

#### Callbacks and Plugins for Security Guardrails

Callbacks provide a simple, agent-specific method for adding pre-validation to tool and model I/O, whereas plugins offer a reusable solution for implementing general security policies across multiple agents.

When modifications to the tools to add guardrails aren't possible, the [**`Before Tool Callback`**](../callbacks/types-of-callbacks.md#before-tool-callback) function can be used to add pre-validation of calls. The callback has access to the agent's state, the requested tool and parameters. This approach is very general and can even be created to create a common library of re-usable tool policies. However, it might not be applicable for all tools if the information to enforce the guardrails isn't directly visible in the parameters.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    # Hypothetical callback function
    def validate_tool_params(
        callback_context: CallbackContext, # Correct context type
        tool: BaseTool,
        args: Dict[str, Any],
        tool_context: ToolContext
        ) -> Optional[Dict]: # Correct return type for before_tool_callback
    
      print(f"Callback triggered for tool: {tool.name}, args: {args}")
    
      # Example validation: Check if a required user ID from state matches an arg
      expected_user_id = callback_context.state.get("session_user_id")
      actual_user_id_in_args = args.get("user_id_param") # Assuming tool takes 'user_id_param'
    
      if actual_user_id_in_args != expected_user_id:
          print("Validation Failed: User ID mismatch!")
          # Return a dictionary to prevent tool execution and provide feedback
          return {"error": f"Tool call blocked: User ID mismatch."}
    
      # Return None to allow the tool call to proceed if validation passes
      print("Callback validation passed.")
      return None
    
    # Hypothetical Agent setup
    root_agent = LlmAgent( # Use specific agent type
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='root_agent',
        instruction="...",
        before_tool_callback=validate_tool_params, # Assign the callback
        tools = [
          # ... list of tool functions or Tool instances ...
          # e.g., query_tool_instance
        ]
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Hypothetical callback function
    public Optional<Map<String, Object>> validateToolParams(
      CallbackContext callbackContext,
      Tool baseTool,
      Map<String, Object> input,
      ToolContext toolContext) {

    System.out.printf("Callback triggered for tool: %s, Args: %s", baseTool.name(), input);
    
    // Example validation: Check if a required user ID from state matches an input parameter
    Object expectedUserId = callbackContext.state().get("session_user_id");
    Object actualUserIdInput = input.get("user_id_param"); // Assuming tool takes 'user_id_param'
    
    if (!actualUserIdInput.equals(expectedUserId)) {
      System.out.println("Validation Failed: User ID mismatch!");
      // Return to prevent tool execution and provide feedback
      return Optional.of(Map.of("error", "Tool call blocked: User ID mismatch."));
    }
    
    // Return to allow the tool call to proceed if validation passes
    System.out.println("Callback validation passed.");
    return Optional.empty();
    }
    
    // Hypothetical Agent setup
    public void runAgent() {
    LlmAgent agent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .name("AgentWithBeforeToolCallback")
            .instruction("...")
            .beforeToolCallback(this::validateToolParams) // Assign the callback
            .tools(anyToolToUse) // Define the tool to be used
            .build();
    }
    ```

However, when adding security guardrails to your agent applications, plugins are the recommended approach for implementing policies that are not specific to a single agent. Plugins are designed to be self-contained and modular, allowing you to create individual plugins for specific security policies, and apply them globally at the runner level. This means that a security plugin can be configured once and applied to every agent that uses the runner, ensuring consistent security guardrails across your entire application without repetitive code.

Some examples include:

* **Gemini as a Judge Plugin**: This plugin uses Gemini Flash Lite to evaluate user inputs, tool input and output, and agent's response for appropriateness, prompt injection, and jailbreak detection. The plugin configures Gemini to act as a safety filter to mitigate against content safety, brand safety, and agent misalignment. The plugin is configured to pass user input, tool input and output, and model output to Gemini Flash Lite, who decides if the input to the agent is safe or unsafe. If Gemini decides the input is unsafe, the agent returns a predetermined response: "Sorry I cannot help with that. Can I help you with something else?".

* **Model Armor Plugin**: A plugin that queries the model armor API to check for potential content safety violations at specified points of agent execution. Similar to the _Gemini as a Judge_ plugin, if Model Armor finds matches of harmful content, it returns a predetermined response to the user.

* **PII Redaction Plugin**: A specialized plugin with design for the [Before Tool Callback](/adk-docs/plugins/#tool-callbacks) and specifically created to redact personally identifiable information before it’s processed by a tool or sent to an external service.

### Sandboxed Code Execution

Code execution is a special tool that has extra security implications: sandboxing must be used to prevent model-generated code to compromise the local environment, potentially creating security issues.

Google and the ADK provide several options for safe code execution. [Vertex Gemini Enterprise API code execution feature](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/code-execution-api) enables agents to take advantage of sandboxed code execution server-side by enabling the tool\_execution tool. For code performing data analysis, you can use the [built-in Code Executor](../tools/built-in-tools.md#code-execution) tool in ADK to call the [Vertex Code Interpreter Extension](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/extensions/code-interpreter).

If none of these options satisfy your requirements, you can build your own code executor using the building blocks provided by the ADK. We recommend creating execution environments that are hermetic: no network connections and API calls permitted to avoid uncontrolled data exfiltration; and full clean up of data across execution to not create cross-user exfiltration concerns.

### Evaluations

See [Evaluate Agents](../evaluate/index.md).

### VPC-SC Perimeters and Network Controls

If you are executing your agent into a VPC-SC perimeter, that will guarantee that all API calls will only be manipulating resources within the perimeter, reducing the chance of data exfiltration.

However, identity and perimeters only provide coarse controls around agent actions. Tool-use guardrails mitigate such limitations, and give more power to agent developers to finely control which actions to allow.

### Other Security Risks

#### Always Escape Model-Generated Content in UIs

Care must be taken when agent output is visualized in a browser: if HTML or JS content isn't properly escaped in the UI, the text returned by the model could be executed, leading to data exfiltration. For example, an indirect prompt injection can trick a model to include an img tag tricking the browser to send the session content to a 3rd party site; or construct URLs that, if clicked, send data to external sites. Proper escaping of such content must ensure that model-generated text isn't interpreted as code by browsers.

# Vertex AI Express Mode: Using Vertex AI Sessions and Memory for Free

If you are interested in using either the `VertexAiSessionService` or `VertexAiMemoryBankService` but you don't have a Google Cloud Project, you can sign up for Vertex AI Express Mode and get access
for free and try out these services! You can sign up with an eligible ***gmail*** account [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/expressmode). For more details about Vertex AI Express mode, see the [overview page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview).
Once you sign up, get an [API key](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview#api-keys) and you can get started using your local ADK agent with Vertex AI Session and Memory services!

!!! info Vertex AI Express mode limitations

    Vertex AI Express Mode has certain limitations in the free tier. Free Express mode projects are only valid for 90 days and only select services are available to be used with limited quota. For example, the number of Agent Engines is restricted to 10 and deployment to Agent Engine is reserved for the paid tier only. To remove the quota restrictions and use all of Vertex AI's services, add a billing account to your Express Mode project.

## Create an Agent Engine

`Session` objects are children of an `AgentEngine`. When using Vertex AI Express Mode, we can create an empty `AgentEngine` parent to manage all of our `Session` and `Memory` objects.
First, ensure that your environment variables are set correctly. For example, in Python:

```env title="weather_agent/.env"
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_EXPRESS_MODE_API_KEY_HERE
```

Next, we can create our Agent Engine instance. You can use the Gen AI SDK.

=== "Gen AI SDK"

    1. Import Gen AI SDK.

        ```py
        from google import genai
        ```

    2. Set Vertex AI to be True, then use a `POST` request to create the Agent Engine
        
        ```py
        # Create Agent Engine with Gen AI SDK
        client = genai.Client(vertexai=True)._api_client

        response = client.request(
            http_method='POST',
            path=f'reasoningEngines',
            request_dict={"displayName": "YOUR_AGENT_ENGINE_DISPLAY_NAME", "description": "YOUR_AGENT_ENGINE_DESCRIPTION"},
        )
        response
        ```

    3. Replace `YOUR_AGENT_ENGINE_DISPLAY_NAME` and `YOUR_AGENT_ENGINE_DESCRIPTION` with your use case.
    4. Get the Agent Engine name and ID from the response

        ```py
        APP_NAME = "/".join(response['name'].split("/")[:6])
        APP_ID = APP_NAME.split('/')[-1]
        ```

## Managing Sessions with a `VertexAiSessionService`

[`VertexAiSessionService`](session.md###sessionservice-implementations) is compatible with Vertex AI Express mode API Keys. We can 
instead initialize the session object without any project or location.

```py
# Requires: pip install google-adk[vertexai]
# Plus environment variable setup:
# GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_EXPRESS_MODE_API_KEY_HERE
from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiSessionService

# The app_name used with this service should be the Reasoning Engine ID or name
APP_ID = "your-reasoning-engine-id"

# Project and location are not required when initializing with Vertex Express Mode
session_service = VertexAiSessionService(agent_engine_id=APP_ID)
# Use REASONING_ENGINE_APP_ID when calling service methods, e.g.:
# session = await session_service.create_session(app_name=REASONING_ENGINE_APP_ID, user_id= ...)
```

!!! info Session Service Quotas

    For Free Express Mode Projects, `VertexAiSessionService` has the following quota:

    - 100 Session Entities
    - 10,000 Event Entities

## Managing Memories with a `VertexAiMemoryBankService`

[`VertexAiMemoryBankService`](memory.md###memoryservice-implementations) is compatible with Vertex AI Express mode API Keys. We can 
instead initialize the memory object without any project or location.

```py
# Requires: pip install google-adk[vertexai]
# Plus environment variable setup:
# GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_EXPRESS_MODE_API_KEY_HERE
from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiMemoryBankService

# The app_name used with this service should be the Reasoning Engine ID or name
APP_ID = "your-reasoning-engine-id"

# Project and location are not required when initializing with Vertex Express Mode
memory_service = VertexAiMemoryBankService(agent_engine_id=APP_ID)
# Generate a memory from that session so the Agent can remember relevant details about the user
# memory = await memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)
```

!!! info Memory Service Quotas

    For Free Express Mode Projects, `VertexAiMemoryBankService` has the following quota:

    - 200 Memory Entities

## Code Sample: Weather Agent with Session and Memory using Vertex AI Express Mode

In this sample, we create a weather agent that utilizes both `VertexAiSessionService` and `VertexAiMemoryBankService` for context management, allowing our agent to recall user preferences and conversations!

# Introduction to Conversational Context: Session, State, and Memory

## Why Context Matters

Meaningful, multi-turn conversations require agents to understand context. Just
like humans, they need to recall the conversation history: what's been said and
done to maintain continuity and avoid repetition. The Agent Development Kit
(ADK) provides structured ways to manage this context through `Session`,
`State`, and `Memory`.

## Core Concepts

Think of different instances of your conversations with the agent as distinct
**conversation threads**, potentially drawing upon **long-term knowledge**.

1.  **`Session`**: The Current Conversation Thread

    *   Represents a *single, ongoing interaction* between a user and your agent
        system.
    *   Contains the chronological sequence of messages and actions taken by the
        agent (referred to `Events`) during *that specific interaction*.
    *   A `Session` can also hold temporary data (`State`) relevant only *during
        this conversation*.

2.  **`State` (`session.state`)**: Data Within the Current Conversation

    *   Data stored within a specific `Session`.
    *   Used to manage information relevant *only* to the *current, active*
        conversation thread (e.g., items in a shopping cart *during this chat*,
        user preferences mentioned *in this session*).

3.  **`Memory`**: Searchable, Cross-Session Information

    *   Represents a store of information that might span *multiple past
        sessions* or include external data sources.
    *   It acts as a knowledge base the agent can *search* to recall information
        or context beyond the immediate conversation.

## Managing Context: Services

ADK provides services to manage these concepts:

1.  **`SessionService`**: Manages the different conversation threads (`Session`
    objects)

    *   Handles the lifecycle: creating, retrieving, updating (appending
        `Events`, modifying `State`), and deleting individual `Session`s.

2.  **`MemoryService`**: Manages the Long-Term Knowledge Store (`Memory`)

    *   Handles ingesting information (often from completed `Session`s) into the
        long-term store.
    *   Provides methods to search this stored knowledge based on queries.

**Implementations**: ADK offers different implementations for both
`SessionService` and `MemoryService`, allowing you to choose the storage backend
that best fits your application's needs. Notably, **in-memory implementations**
are provided for both services; these are designed specifically for **local
testing and fast development**. It's important to remember that **all data
stored using these in-memory options (sessions, state, or long-term knowledge)
is lost when your application restarts**. For persistence and scalability beyond
local testing, ADK also offers cloud-based and database service options.

**In Summary:**

*   **`Session` & `State`**: Focus on the **current interaction** – the history
    and data of the *single, active conversation*. Managed primarily by a
    `SessionService`.
*   **Memory**: Focuses on the **past and external information** – a *searchable
    archive* potentially spanning across conversations. Managed by a
    `MemoryService`.

## What's Next?

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these components:

*   **`Session`**: Understanding its structure and `Events`.
*   **`State`**: How to effectively read, write, and manage session-specific
    data.
*   **`SessionService`**: Choosing the right storage backend for your sessions.
*   **`MemoryService`**: Exploring options for storing and retrieving broader
    context.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental to building agents that can engage
in complex, stateful, and context-aware conversations.

# Memory: Long-Term Knowledge with `MemoryService`

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

We've seen how `Session` tracks the history (`events`) and temporary data (`state`) for a *single, ongoing conversation*. But what if an agent needs to recall information from *past* conversations? This is where the concept of **Long-Term Knowledge** and the **`MemoryService`** come into play.

Think of it this way:

* **`Session` / `State`:** Like your short-term memory during one specific chat.  
* **Long-Term Knowledge (`MemoryService`)**: Like a searchable archive or knowledge library the agent can consult, potentially containing information from many past chats or other sources.

## The `MemoryService` Role

The `BaseMemoryService` defines the interface for managing this searchable, long-term knowledge store. Its primary responsibilities are:

1. **Ingesting Information (`add_session_to_memory`):** Taking the contents of a (usually completed) `Session` and adding relevant information to the long-term knowledge store.  
2. **Searching Information (`search_memory`):** Allowing an agent (typically via a `Tool`) to query the knowledge store and retrieve relevant snippets or context based on a search query.

## Choosing the Right Memory Service

The ADK offers two distinct `MemoryService` implementations, each tailored to different use cases. Use the table below to decide which is the best fit for your agent.

| **Feature** | **InMemoryMemoryService** | **VertexAiMemoryBankService** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Persistence** | None (data is lost on restart) | Yes (Managed by Vertex AI) |
| **Primary Use Case** | Prototyping, local development, and simple testing. | Building meaningful, evolving memories from user conversations. |
| **Memory Extraction** | Stores full conversation | Extracts [meaningful information](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/memory-bank/generate-memories) from conversations and consolidates it with existing memories (powered by LLM) |
| **Search Capability** | Basic keyword matching. | Advanced semantic search. |
| **Setup Complexity** | None. It's the default. | Low. Requires an [Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/memory-bank/overview) instance in Vertex AI. |
| **Dependencies** | None. | Google Cloud Project, Vertex AI API |
| **When to use it** | When you want to search across multiple sessions’ chat histories for prototyping. | When you want your agent to remember and learn from past interactions. |

## In-Memory Memory

The `InMemoryMemoryService` stores session information in the application's memory and performs basic keyword matching for searches. It requires no setup and is best for prototyping and simple testing scenarios where persistence isn't required.

```py
from google.adk.memory import InMemoryMemoryService
memory_service = InMemoryMemoryService()
```

**Example: Adding and Searching Memory**

This example demonstrates the basic flow using the `InMemoryMemoryService` for simplicity.

## Vertex AI Memory Bank

The `VertexAiMemoryBankService` connects your agent to [Vertex AI Memory Bank](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/memory-bank/overview), a fully managed Google Cloud service that provides sophisticated, persistent memory capabilities for conversational agents.

### How It Works

The service handles two key operations:

*   **Generating Memories:** At the end of a conversation, you can send the session's events to the Memory Bank, which intelligently processes and stores the information as "memories."
*   **Retrieving Memories:** Your agent code can issue a search query against the Memory Bank to retrieve relevant memories from past conversations.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this feature, you must have:

1.  **A Google Cloud Project:** With the Vertex AI API enabled.
2.  **An Agent Engine:** You need to create an Agent Engine in Vertex AI. You do not need to deploy your agent to Agent Engine Runtime to use Memory Bank. This will provide you with the **Agent Engine ID** required for configuration.
3.  **Authentication:** Ensure your local environment is authenticated to access Google Cloud services. The simplest way is to run:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
4.  **Environment Variables:** The service requires your Google Cloud Project ID and Location. Set them as environment variables:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="your-gcp-location"
    ```

### Configuration

To connect your agent to the Memory Bank, you use the `--memory_service_uri` flag when starting the ADK server (`adk web` or `adk api_server`). The URI must be in the format `agentengine://<agent_engine_id>`.

```bash title="bash"
adk web path/to/your/agents_dir --memory_service_uri="agentengine://1234567890"
```

Or, you can configure your agent to use the Memory Bank by manually instantiating the `VertexAiMemoryBankService` and passing it to the `Runner`.

```py
from google.adk.memory import VertexAiMemoryBankService

agent_engine_id = agent_engine.api_resource.name.split("/")[-1]

memory_service = VertexAiMemoryBankService(
    project="PROJECT_ID",
    location="LOCATION",
    agent_engine_id=agent_engine_id
)

runner = adk.Runner(
    ...
    memory_service=memory_service
)
``` 

## Using Memory in Your Agent

When a memory service is configured, your agent can use a tool or callback to retrieve memories. ADK includes two pre-built tools for retrieving memories:

* `PreloadMemory`: Always retrieve memory at the beginning of each turn (similar to a callback).
* `LoadMemory`: Retrieve memory when your agent decides it would be helpful.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.preload_memory_tool import PreloadMemoryTool

agent = Agent(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    name='weather_sentiment_agent',
    instruction="...",
    tools=[PreloadMemoryTool()]
)
```

To extract memories from your session, you need to call `add_session_to_memory`. For example, you can automate this via a callback:

```python
from google import adk

async def auto_save_session_to_memory_callback(callback_context):
    await callback_context._invocation_context.memory_service.add_session_to_memory(
        callback_context._invocation_context.session)

agent = Agent(
    model=MODEL,
    name="Generic_QA_Agent",
    instruction="Answer the user's questions",
    tools=[adk.tools.preload_memory_tool.PreloadMemoryTool()],
    after_agent_callback=auto_save_session_to_memory_callback,
)
```

## Advanced Concepts

### How Memory Works in Practice

The memory workflow internally involves these steps:

1. **Session Interaction:** A user interacts with an agent via a `Session`, managed by a `SessionService`. Events are added, and state might be updated.  
2. **Ingestion into Memory:** At some point (often when a session is considered complete or has yielded significant information), your application calls `memory_service.add_session_to_memory(session)`. This extracts relevant information from the session's events and adds it to the long-term knowledge store (in-memory dictionary or Agent Engine Memory Bank).  
3. **Later Query:** In a *different* (or the same) session, the user might ask a question requiring past context (e.g., "What did we discuss about project X last week?").  
4. **Agent Uses Memory Tool:** An agent equipped with a memory-retrieval tool (like the built-in `load_memory` tool) recognizes the need for past context. It calls the tool, providing a search query (e.g., "discussion project X last week").  
5. **Search Execution:** The tool internally calls `memory_service.search_memory(app_name, user_id, query)`.  
6. **Results Returned:** The `MemoryService` searches its store (using keyword matching or semantic search) and returns relevant snippets as a `SearchMemoryResponse` containing a list of `MemoryResult` objects (each potentially holding events from a relevant past session).  
7. **Agent Uses Results:** The tool returns these results to the agent, usually as part of the context or function response. The agent can then use this retrieved information to formulate its final answer to the user.

### Can an agent have access to more than one memory service?

*   **Through Standard Configuration: No.** The framework (`adk web`, `adk api_server`) is designed to be configured with one single memory service at a time via the `--memory_service_uri` flag. This single service is then provided to the agent and accessed through the built-in `self.search_memory()` method. From a configuration standpoint, you can only choose one backend (`InMemory`, `VertexAiMemoryBankService`) for all agents served by that process.

*   **Within Your Agent's Code: Yes, absolutely.** There is nothing preventing you from manually importing and instantiating another memory service directly inside your agent's code. This allows you to access multiple memory sources within a single agent turn.

For example, your agent could use the framework-configured `VertexAiMemoryBankService` to recall conversational history, and also manually instantiate a `InMemoryMemoryService` to look up information in a technical manual.

#### Example: Using Two Memory Services

Here’s how you could implement that in your agent's code:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.memory import InMemoryMemoryService, VertexAiMemoryBankService
from google.genai import types

class MultiMemoryAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        self.memory_service = InMemoryMemoryService()
        # Manually instantiate a second memory service for document lookups
        self.vertexai_memorybank_service = VertexAiMemoryBankService(
            project="PROJECT_ID",
            location="LOCATION",
            agent_engine_id="AGENT_ENGINE_ID"
        )

    async def run(self, request: types.Content, **kwargs) -> types.Content:
        user_query = request.parts[0].text

        # 1. Search conversational history using the framework-provided memory
        #    (This would be InMemoryMemoryService if configured)
        conversation_context = await self.memory_service.search_memory(query=user_query)

        # 2. Search the document knowledge base using the manually created service
        document_context = await self.vertexai_memorybank_service.search_memory(query=user_query)

        # Combine the context from both sources to generate a better response
        prompt = "From our past conversations, I remember:\n"
        prompt += f"{conversation_context.memories}\n\n"
        prompt += "From the technical manuals, I found:\n"
        prompt += f"{document_context.memories}\n\n"
        prompt += f"Based on all this, here is my answer to '{user_query}':"

        return await self.llm.generate_content_async(prompt)
```

# Session: Tracking Individual Conversations

Following our Introduction, let's dive into the `Session`. Think back to the
idea of a "conversation thread." Just like you wouldn't start every text message
from scratch, agents need context regarding the ongoing interaction.
**`Session`** is the ADK object designed specifically to track and manage these
individual conversation threads.

## The `Session` Object

When a user starts interacting with your agent, the `SessionService` creates a
`Session` object (`google.adk.sessions.Session`). This object acts as the
container holding everything related to that *one specific chat thread*. Here
are its key properties:

*   **Identification (`id`, `appName`, `userId`):** Unique labels for the
    conversation.
    * `id`: A unique identifier for *this specific* conversation thread, essential for retrieving it later. A SessionService object can handle multiple `Session`(s). This field identifies which particular session object are we referring to. For example, "test_id_modification".
    * `app_name`: Identifies which agent application this conversation belongs to. For example, "id_modifier_workflow". 
    *   `userId`: Links the conversation to a particular user.
*   **History (`events`):** A chronological sequence of all interactions
    (`Event` objects – user messages, agent responses, tool actions) that have
    occurred within this specific thread.
*   **Session State (`state`):** A place to store temporary data relevant *only*
    to this specific, ongoing conversation. This acts as a scratchpad for the
    agent during the interaction. We will cover how to use and manage `state` in
    detail in the next section.
*   **Activity Tracking (`lastUpdateTime`):** A timestamp indicating the last
    time an event occurred in this conversation thread.

### Example: Examining Session Properties


=== "Python"

       ```py
        from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session
    
        # Create a simple session to examine its properties
        temp_service = InMemorySessionService()
        example_session = await temp_service.create_session(
            app_name="my_app",
            user_id="example_user",
            state={"initial_key": "initial_value"} # State can be initialized
        )

        print(f"--- Examining Session Properties ---")
        print(f"ID (`id`):                {example_session.id}")
        print(f"Application Name (`app_name`): {example_session.app_name}")
        print(f"User ID (`user_id`):         {example_session.user_id}")
        print(f"State (`state`):           {example_session.state}") # Note: Only shows initial state here
        print(f"Events (`events`):         {example_session.events}") # Initially empty
        print(f"Last Update (`last_update_time`): {example_session.last_update_time:.2f}")
        print(f"---------------------------------")

        # Clean up (optional for this example)
        temp_service = await temp_service.delete_session(app_name=example_session.app_name,
                                    user_id=example_session.user_id, session_id=example_session.id)
        print("The final status of temp_service - ", temp_service)
       ```

=== "Java"

       ```java
        import com.google.adk.sessions.InMemorySessionService;
        import com.google.adk.sessions.Session;
        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;
        import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
    
        String sessionId = "123";
        String appName = "example-app"; // Example app name
        String userId = "example-user"; // Example user id
        ConcurrentMap<String, Object> initialState = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(Map.of("newKey", "newValue"));
        InMemorySessionService exampleSessionService = new InMemorySessionService();
    
        // Create Session
        Session exampleSession = exampleSessionService.createSession(
            appName, userId, initialState, Optional.of(sessionId)).blockingGet();
        System.out.println("Session created successfully.");
    
        System.out.println("--- Examining Session Properties ---");
        System.out.printf("ID (`id`): %s%n", exampleSession.id());
        System.out.printf("Application Name (`appName`): %s%n", exampleSession.appName());
        System.out.printf("User ID (`userId`): %s%n", exampleSession.userId());
        System.out.printf("State (`state`): %s%n", exampleSession.state());
        System.out.println("------------------------------------");
    
    
        // Clean up (optional for this example)
        var unused = exampleSessionService.deleteSession(appName, userId, sessionId);
       ```

*(**Note:** The state shown above is only the initial state. State updates
happen via events, as discussed in the State section.)*

## Managing Sessions with a `SessionService`

As seen above, you don't typically create or manage `Session` objects directly.
Instead, you use a **`SessionService`**. This service acts as the central
manager responsible for the entire lifecycle of your conversation sessions.

Its core responsibilities include:

*   **Starting New Conversations:** Creating fresh `Session` objects when a user
    begins an interaction.
*   **Resuming Existing Conversations:** Retrieving a specific `Session` (using
    its ID) so the agent can continue where it left off.
*   **Saving Progress:** Appending new interactions (`Event` objects) to a
    session's history. This is also the mechanism through which session `state`
    gets updated (more in the `State` section).
*   **Listing Conversations:** Finding the active session threads for a
    particular user and application.
*   **Cleaning Up:** Deleting `Session` objects and their associated data when
    conversations are finished or no longer needed.

## `SessionService` Implementations

ADK provides different `SessionService` implementations, allowing you to choose
the storage backend that best suits your needs:

1.  **`InMemorySessionService`**

    *   **How it works:** Stores all session data directly in the application's
        memory.
    *   **Persistence:** None. **All conversation data is lost if the
        application restarts.**
    *   **Requires:** Nothing extra.
    *   **Best for:** Quick development, local testing, examples, and scenarios
        where long-term persistence isn't required.

    === "Python"
    
           ```py
            from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
            session_service = InMemorySessionService()
           ```
    === "Java"
    
           ```java
            import com.google.adk.sessions.InMemorySessionService;
            InMemorySessionService exampleSessionService = new InMemorySessionService();
           ```

2.  **`VertexAiSessionService`**

    *   **How it works:** Uses Google Cloud Vertex AI infrastructure via API
        calls for session management.
    *   **Persistence:** Yes. Data is managed reliably and scalably via
        [Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/).
    *   **Requires:**
        *   A Google Cloud project (`pip install vertexai`)
        *   A Google Cloud storage bucket that can be configured by this
            [step](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/configure-project#storage).
        *   A Reasoning Engine resource name/ID that can setup following this
            [tutorial](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/).
        *   If you do not have a Google Cloud project and you want to try the VertexAiSessionService for free, see how to [try Session and Memory for free.](express-mode.md)
    *   **Best for:** Scalable production applications deployed on Google Cloud,
        especially when integrating with other Vertex AI features.

    === "Python"
    
           ```py
           # Requires: pip install google-adk[vertexai]
           # Plus GCP setup and authentication
           from google.adk.sessions import VertexAiSessionService

           PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
           LOCATION = "us-central1"
           # The app_name used with this service should be the Reasoning Engine ID or name
           REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME = "projects/your-gcp-project-id/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/your-engine-id"

           session_service = VertexAiSessionService(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
           # Use REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME when calling service methods, e.g.:
           # session_service = await session_service.create_session(app_name=REASONING_ENGINE_APP_NAME, ...)
           ```
       
    === "Java"
    
           ```java
           // Please look at the set of requirements above, consequently export the following in your bashrc file:
           // export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=my_gcp_project
           // export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
           // export GOOGLE_API_KEY=my_api_key

           import com.google.adk.sessions.VertexAiSessionService;
           import java.util.UUID;

           String sessionId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
           String reasoningEngineAppName = "123456789";
           String userId = "u_123"; // Example user id
           ConcurrentMap<String, Object> initialState = new
               ConcurrentHashMap<>(); // No initial state needed for this example

           VertexAiSessionService sessionService = new VertexAiSessionService();
           Session mySession =
               sessionService
                   .createSession(reasoningEngineAppName, userId, initialState, Optional.of(sessionId))
                   .blockingGet();
           ```

3.  **`DatabaseSessionService`**

    ![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

    *   **How it works:** Connects to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL,
        MySQL, SQLite) to store session data persistently in tables.
    *   **Persistence:** Yes. Data survives application restarts.
    *   **Requires:** A configured database.
    *   **Best for:** Applications needing reliable, persistent storage that you
        manage yourself.

    ```py
    from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService
    # Example using a local SQLite file:
    db_url = "sqlite:///./my_agent_data.db"
    session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)
    ```

Choosing the right `SessionService` is key to defining how your agent's
conversation history and temporary data are stored and persist.

## The Session Lifecycle

<img src="../../assets/session_lifecycle.png" alt="Session lifecycle">

Here’s a simplified flow of how `Session` and `SessionService` work together
during a conversation turn:

1.  **Start or Resume:** Your application needs to use the `SessionService` to
    either `create_session` (for a new chat) or use an existing session id.
2.  **Context Provided:** The `Runner` gets the appropriate `Session` object
    from the appropriate service method, providing the agent with access to the
    corresponding Session's `state` and `events`.
3.  **Agent Processing:** The user prompts the agent with a query. The agent
    analyzes the query and potentially the session `state` and `events` history
    to determine the response.
4.  **Response & State Update:** The agent generates a response (and potentially
    flags data to be updated in the `state`). The `Runner` packages this as an
    `Event`.
5.  **Save Interaction:** The `Runner` calls
    `sessionService.append_event(session, event)` with the `session` and the new
    `event` as the arguments. The service adds the `Event` to the history and
    updates the session's `state` in storage based on information within the
    event. The session's `last_update_time` also get updated.
6.  **Ready for Next:** The agent's response goes to the user. The updated
    `Session` is now stored by the `SessionService`, ready for the next turn
    (which restarts the cycle at step 1, usually with the continuation of the
    conversation in the current session).
7.  **End Conversation:** When the conversation is over, your application calls
    `sessionService.delete_session(...)` to clean up the stored session data if
    it is no longer required.

This cycle highlights how the `SessionService` ensures conversational continuity
by managing the history and state associated with each `Session` object.

# State: The Session's Scratchpad

Within each `Session` (our conversation thread), the **`state`** attribute acts like the agent's dedicated scratchpad for that specific interaction. While `session.events` holds the full history, `session.state` is where the agent stores and updates dynamic details needed *during* the conversation.

## What is `session.state`?

Conceptually, `session.state` is a collection (dictionary or Map) holding key-value pairs. It's designed for information the agent needs to recall or track to make the current conversation effective:

* **Personalize Interaction:** Remember user preferences mentioned earlier (e.g., `'user_preference_theme': 'dark'`).
* **Track Task Progress:** Keep tabs on steps in a multi-turn process (e.g., `'booking_step': 'confirm_payment'`).
* **Accumulate Information:** Build lists or summaries (e.g., `'shopping_cart_items': ['book', 'pen']`).
* **Make Informed Decisions:** Store flags or values influencing the next response (e.g., `'user_is_authenticated': True`).

### Key Characteristics of `State`

1. **Structure: Serializable Key-Value Pairs**

    * Data is stored as `key: value`.
    * **Keys:** Always strings (`str`). Use clear names (e.g., `'departure_city'`, `'user:language_preference'`).
    * **Values:** Must be **serializable**. This means they can be easily saved and loaded by the `SessionService`. Stick to basic types in the specific languages (Python/ Java) like strings, numbers, booleans, and simple lists or dictionaries containing *only* these basic types. (See API documentation for precise details).
    * **⚠️ Avoid Complex Objects:** **Do not store non-serializable objects** (custom class instances, functions, connections, etc.) directly in the state. Store simple identifiers if needed, and retrieve the complex object elsewhere.

2. **Mutability: It Changes**

    * The contents of the `state` are expected to change as the conversation evolves.

3. **Persistence: Depends on `SessionService`**

    * Whether state survives application restarts depends on your chosen service:
      * `InMemorySessionService`: **Not Persistent.** State is lost on restart.
      * `DatabaseSessionService` / `VertexAiSessionService`: **Persistent.** State is saved reliably.

!!! Note
    The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `session.state['current_intent'] = 'book_flight'` in Python, `session.state().put("current_intent", "book_flight)` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Organizing State with Prefixes: Scope Matters

Prefixes on state keys define their scope and persistence behavior, especially with persistent services:

* **No Prefix (Session State):**

    * **Scope:** Specific to the *current* session (`id`).
    * **Persistence:** Only persists if the `SessionService` is persistent (`Database`, `VertexAI`).
    * **Use Cases:** Tracking progress within the current task (e.g., `'current_booking_step'`), temporary flags for this interaction (e.g., `'needs_clarification'`).
    * **Example:** `session.state['current_intent'] = 'book_flight'`

* **`user:` Prefix (User State):**

    * **Scope:** Tied to the `user_id`, shared across *all* sessions for that user (within the same `app_name`).
    * **Persistence:** Persistent with `Database` or `VertexAI`. (Stored by `InMemory` but lost on restart).
    * **Use Cases:** User preferences (e.g., `'user:theme'`), profile details (e.g., `'user:name'`).
    * **Example:** `session.state['user:preferred_language'] = 'fr'`

* **`app:` Prefix (App State):**

    * **Scope:** Tied to the `app_name`, shared across *all* users and sessions for that application.
    * **Persistence:** Persistent with `Database` or `VertexAI`. (Stored by `InMemory` but lost on restart).
    * **Use Cases:** Global settings (e.g., `'app:api_endpoint'`), shared templates.
    * **Example:** `session.state['app:global_discount_code'] = 'SAVE10'`

* **`temp:` Prefix (Temporary Invocation State):**

    * **Scope:** Specific to the current **invocation** (the entire process from an agent receiving user input to generating the final output for that input).
    * **Persistence:** **Not Persistent.** Discarded after the invocation completes and does not carry over to the next one.
    * **Use Cases:** Storing intermediate calculations, flags, or data passed between tool calls within a single invocation.
    * **When Not to Use:** For information that must persist across different invocations, such as user preferences, conversation history summaries, or accumulated data.
    * **Example:** `session.state['temp:raw_api_response'] = {...}`

!!! note "Sub-Agents and Invocation Context"
    When a parent agent calls a sub-agent (e.g., using `SequentialAgent` or `ParallelAgent`), it passes its `InvocationContext` to the sub-agent. This means the entire chain of agent calls shares the same invocation ID and, therefore, the same `temp:` state.

**How the Agent Sees It:** Your agent code interacts with the *combined* state through the single `session.state` collection (dict/ Map). The `SessionService` handles fetching/merging state from the correct underlying storage based on prefixes.

### Accessing Session State in Agent Instructions

When working with `LlmAgent` instances, you can directly inject session state values into the agent's instruction string using a simple templating syntax. This allows you to create dynamic and context-aware instructions without relying solely on natural language directives.

#### Using `{key}` Templating

To inject a value from the session state, enclose the key of the desired state variable within curly braces: `{key}`. The framework will automatically replace this placeholder with the corresponding value from `session.state` before passing the instruction to the LLM.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

story_generator = LlmAgent(
    name="StoryGenerator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="""Write a short story about a cat, focusing on the theme: {topic}."""
)

# Assuming session.state['topic'] is set to "friendship", the LLM 
# will receive the following instruction:
# "Write a short story about a cat, focusing on the theme: friendship."
```

#### Important Considerations

* Key Existence: Ensure that the key you reference in the instruction string exists in the session.state. If the key is missing, the agent will throw an error. To use a key that may or may not be present, you can include a question mark (?) after the key (e.g. {topic?}).
* Data Types: The value associated with the key should be a string or a type that can be easily converted to a string.
* Escaping: If you need to use literal curly braces in your instruction (e.g., for JSON formatting), you'll need to escape them.

#### Bypassing State Injection with `InstructionProvider`

In some cases, you might want to use `{{` and `}}` literally in your instructions without triggering the state injection mechanism. For example, you might be writing instructions for an agent that helps with a templating language that uses the same syntax.

To achieve this, you can provide a function to the `instruction` parameter instead of a string. This function is called an `InstructionProvider`. When you use an `InstructionProvider`, the ADK will not attempt to inject state, and your instruction string will be passed to the model as-is.

The `InstructionProvider` function receives a `ReadonlyContext` object, which you can use to access session state or other contextual information if you need to build the instruction dynamically.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.agents.readonly_context import ReadonlyContext

    # This is an InstructionProvider
    def my_instruction_provider(context: ReadonlyContext) -> str:
        # You can optionally use the context to build the instruction
        # For this example, we'll return a static string with literal braces.
        return "This is an instruction with {{literal_braces}} that will not be replaced."

    agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="template_helper_agent",
        instruction=my_instruction_provider
    )
    ```

If you want to both use an `InstructionProvider` *and* inject state into your instructions, you can use the `inject_session_state` utility function.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.agents.readonly_context import ReadonlyContext
    from google.adk.utils import instructions_utils

    async def my_dynamic_instruction_provider(context: ReadonlyContext) -> str:
        template = "This is a {adjective} instruction with {{literal_braces}}."
        # This will inject the 'adjective' state variable but leave the literal braces.
        return await instructions_utils.inject_session_state(template, context)

    agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        name="dynamic_template_helper_agent",
        instruction=my_dynamic_instruction_provider
    )
    ```

**Benefits of Direct Injection**

* Clarity: Makes it explicit which parts of the instruction are dynamic and based on session state.
* Reliability: Avoids relying on the LLM to correctly interpret natural language instructions to access state.
* Maintainability: Simplifies instruction strings and reduces the risk of errors when updating state variable names.

**Relation to Other State Access Methods**

This direct injection method is specific to LlmAgent instructions. Refer to the following section for more information on other state access methods.

### How State is Updated: Recommended Methods

!!! note "The Right Way to Modify State"
    When you need to change the session state, the correct and safest method is to **directly modify the `state` object on the `Context`** provided to your function (e.g., `callback_context.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). This is considered "direct state manipulation" in the right way, as the framework automatically tracks these changes.

    This is critically different from directly modifying the `state` on a `Session` object you retrieve from the `SessionService` (e.g., `my_session.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). **You should avoid this**, as it bypasses the ADK's event tracking and can lead to lost data. The "Warning" section at the end of this page has more details on this important distinction.

State should **always** be updated as part of adding an `Event` to the session history using `session_service.append_event()`. This ensures changes are tracked, persistence works correctly, and updates are thread-safe.

**1\. The Easy Way: `output_key` (for Agent Text Responses)**

This is the simplest method for saving an agent's final text response directly into the state. When defining your `LlmAgent`, specify the `output_key`:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session
    from google.adk.runners import Runner
    from google.genai.types import Content, Part

    # Define agent with output_key
    greeting_agent = LlmAgent(
        name="Greeter",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Use a valid model
        instruction="Generate a short, friendly greeting.",
        output_key="last_greeting" # Save response to state['last_greeting']
    )

    # --- Setup Runner and Session ---
    app_name, user_id, session_id = "state_app", "user1", "session1"
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    runner = Runner(
        agent=greeting_agent,
        app_name=app_name,
        session_service=session_service
    )
    session = await session_service.create_session(app_name=app_name,
                                        user_id=user_id,
                                        session_id=session_id)
    print(f"Initial state: {session.state}")

    # --- Run the Agent ---
    # Runner handles calling append_event, which uses the output_key
    # to automatically create the state_delta.
    user_message = Content(parts=[Part(text="Hello")])
    for event in runner.run(user_id=user_id,
                            session_id=session_id,
                            new_message=user_message):
        if event.is_final_response():
          print(f"Agent responded.") # Response text is also in event.content

    # --- Check Updated State ---
    updated_session = await session_service.get_session(app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_id)
    print(f"State after agent run: {updated_session.state}")
    # Expected output might include: {'last_greeting': 'Hello there! How can I help you today?'}
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/state/GreetingAgentExample.java:full_code"
    ```

Behind the scenes, the `Runner` uses the `output_key` to create the necessary `EventActions` with a `state_delta` and calls `append_event`.

**2\. The Standard Way: `EventActions.state_delta` (for Complex Updates)**

For more complex scenarios (updating multiple keys, non-string values, specific scopes like `user:` or `app:`, or updates not tied directly to the agent's final text), you manually construct the `state_delta` within `EventActions`.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session
    from google.adk.events import Event, EventActions
    from google.genai.types import Part, Content
    import time

    # --- Setup ---
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    app_name, user_id, session_id = "state_app_manual", "user2", "session2"
    session = await session_service.create_session(
        app_name=app_name,
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session_id,
        state={"user:login_count": 0, "task_status": "idle"}
    )
    print(f"Initial state: {session.state}")

    # --- Define State Changes ---
    current_time = time.time()
    state_changes = {
        "task_status": "active",              # Update session state
        "user:login_count": session.state.get("user:login_count", 0) + 1, # Update user state
        "user:last_login_ts": current_time,   # Add user state
        "temp:validation_needed": True        # Add temporary state (will be discarded)
    }

    # --- Create Event with Actions ---
    actions_with_update = EventActions(state_delta=state_changes)
    # This event might represent an internal system action, not just an agent response
    system_event = Event(
        invocation_id="inv_login_update",
        author="system", # Or 'agent', 'tool' etc.
        actions=actions_with_update,
        timestamp=current_time
        # content might be None or represent the action taken
    )

    # --- Append the Event (This updates the state) ---
    await session_service.append_event(session, system_event)
    print("`append_event` called with explicit state delta.")

    # --- Check Updated State ---
    updated_session = await session_service.get_session(app_name=app_name,
                                                user_id=user_id,
                                                session_id=session_id)
    print(f"State after event: {updated_session.state}")
    # Expected: {'user:login_count': 1, 'task_status': 'active', 'user:last_login_ts': <timestamp>}
    # Note: 'temp:validation_needed' is NOT present.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/state/ManualStateUpdateExample.java:full_code"
    ```

**3. Via `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` (Recommended for Callbacks and Tools)**

Modifying state within agent callbacks (e.g., `on_before_agent_call`, `on_after_agent_call`) or tool functions is best done using the `state` attribute of the `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` provided to your function.

*   `callback_context.state['my_key'] = my_value`
*   `tool_context.state['my_key'] = my_value`

These context objects are specifically designed to manage state changes within their respective execution scopes. When you modify `context.state`, the ADK framework ensures that these changes are automatically captured and correctly routed into the `EventActions.state_delta` for the event being generated by the callback or tool. This delta is then processed by the `SessionService` when the event is appended, ensuring proper persistence and tracking.

This method abstracts away the manual creation of `EventActions` and `state_delta` for most common state update scenarios within callbacks and tools, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.

For more comprehensive details on context objects, refer to the [Context documentation](../context/index.md).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # In an agent callback or tool function
    from google.adk.agents import CallbackContext # or ToolContext

    def my_callback_or_tool_function(context: CallbackContext, # Or ToolContext
                                     # ... other parameters ...
                                    ):
        # Update existing state
        count = context.state.get("user_action_count", 0)
        context.state["user_action_count"] = count + 1

        # Add new state
        context.state["temp:last_operation_status"] = "success"

        # State changes are automatically part of the event's state_delta
        # ... rest of callback/tool logic ...
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // In an agent callback or tool method
    import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext; // or ToolContext
    // ... other imports ...

    public class MyAgentCallbacks {
        public void onAfterAgent(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
            // Update existing state
            Integer count = (Integer) callbackContext.state().getOrDefault("user_action_count", 0);
            callbackContext.state().put("user_action_count", count + 1);

            // Add new state
            callbackContext.state().put("temp:last_operation_status", "success");

            // State changes are automatically part of the event's state_delta
            // ... rest of callback logic ...
        }
    }
    ```

**What `append_event` Does:**

* Adds the `Event` to `session.events`.
* Reads the `state_delta` from the event's `actions`.
* Applies these changes to the state managed by the `SessionService`, correctly handling prefixes and persistence based on the service type.
* Updates the session's `last_update_time`.
* Ensures thread-safety for concurrent updates.

### ⚠️ A Warning About Direct State Modification

Avoid directly modifying the `session.state` collection (dictionary/Map) on a `Session` object that was obtained directly from the `SessionService` (e.g., via `session_service.get_session()` or `session_service.create_session()`) *outside* of the managed lifecycle of an agent invocation (i.e., not through a `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`). For example, code like `retrieved_session = await session_service.get_session(...); retrieved_session.state['key'] = value` is problematic.

State modifications *within* callbacks or tools using `CallbackContext.state` or `ToolContext.state` are the correct way to ensure changes are tracked, as these context objects handle the necessary integration with the event system.

**Why direct modification (outside of contexts) is strongly discouraged:**

1. **Bypasses Event History:** The change isn't recorded as an `Event`, losing auditability.
2. **Breaks Persistence:** Changes made this way **will likely NOT be saved** by `DatabaseSessionService` or `VertexAiSessionService`. They rely on `append_event` to trigger saving.
3. **Not Thread-Safe:** Can lead to race conditions and lost updates.
4. **Ignores Timestamps/Logic:** Doesn't update `last_update_time` or trigger related event logic.

**Recommendation:** Stick to updating state via `output_key`, `EventActions.state_delta` (when manually creating events), or by modifying the `state` property of `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` objects when within their respective scopes. These methods ensure reliable, trackable, and persistent state management. Use direct access to `session.state` (from a `SessionService`-retrieved session) only for *reading* state.

### Best Practices for State Design Recap

* **Minimalism:** Store only essential, dynamic data.
* **Serialization:** Use basic, serializable types.
* **Descriptive Keys & Prefixes:** Use clear names and appropriate prefixes (`user:`, `app:`, `temp:`, or none).
* **Shallow Structures:** Avoid deep nesting where possible.
* **Standard Update Flow:** Rely on `append_event`.

# ADK Bidi-streaming development guide: Part 1 - Introduction

Welcome to the world of bidirectional streaming with [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). This article will transform your understanding of AI agent communication from traditional request-response patterns to dynamic, real-time conversations that feel as natural as talking to another person.

Imagine building an AI assistant that doesn't just wait for you to finish speaking before responding, but actively listens and can be interrupted mid-sentence when you have a sudden thought. Picture creating customer support bots that handle audio, video, and text simultaneously while maintaining context throughout the conversation. This is the power of bidirectional streaming, and ADK makes it accessible to every developer.

## 1.1 What is Bidi-streaming? { #what-is-bidi-streaming }

Bidi-streaming (Bidirectional streaming) represents a fundamental shift from traditional AI interactions. Instead of the rigid "ask-and-wait" pattern, it enables **real-time, two-way communication** where both human and AI can speak, listen, and respond simultaneously. This creates natural, human-like conversations with immediate responses and the revolutionary ability to interrupt ongoing interactions.

Think of the difference between sending emails and having a phone conversation. Traditional AI interactions are like emails—you send a complete message, wait for a complete response, then send another complete message. Bidirectional streaming is like a phone conversation—fluid, natural, with the ability to interrupt, clarify, and respond in real-time.

### Key Characteristics

These characteristics distinguish bidirectional streaming from traditional AI interactions and make it uniquely powerful for creating engaging user experiences:

- **Two-way Communication**: Continuous data exchange without waiting for complete responses. Either the user and AI can start responding to the first few words of your question while you're still speaking, creating an experience that feels genuinely conversational rather than transactional.

- **Responsive Interruption**: Perhaps the most important feature for the natural user experience—users can interrupt the agent mid-response with new input, just like in human conversation. If an AI is explaining quantum physics and you suddenly ask "wait, what's an electron?", the AI stops immediately and addresses your question.

- **Best for Multimodal**: Simultaneous support for text, audio, and video inputs creates rich, natural interactions. Users can speak while showing documents, type follow-up questions during voice calls, or seamlessly switch between communication modes without losing context.

    participant Client as User
    participant Agent

    Client->>Agent: "Hi!"
    Client->>Agent: "Explain the history of Japan"
    Agent->>Client: "Hello!"
    Agent->>Client: "Sure! Japan's history is a..." (partial content)
    Client->>Agent: "Ah, wait."

    Agent->>Client: "OK, how can I help?" (interrupted = True)
```

### Difference from Other Streaming Types

Understanding how bidirectional streaming differs from other approaches is crucial for appreciating its unique value. The streaming landscape includes several distinct patterns, each serving different use cases:

!!! info "Streaming Types Comparison"

    **Bidi-streaming** differs fundamentally from other streaming approaches:

    - **Server-Side Streaming**: One-way data flow from server to client. Like watching a live video stream—you receive continuous data but can't interact with it in real-time. Useful for dashboards or live feeds, but not for conversations.

    - **Token-Level Streaming**: Sequential text token delivery without interruption. The AI generates response word-by-word, but you must wait for completion before sending new input. Like watching someone type a message in real-time—you see it forming, but can't interrupt.

    - **Bidirectional Streaming**: Full two-way communication with interruption support. True conversational AI where both parties can speak, listen, and respond simultaneously. This is what enables natural dialogue where you can interrupt, clarify, or change topics mid-conversation.

### Real-World Applications

Bidirectional streaming revolutionizes agentic AI applications by enabling agents to operate with human-like responsiveness and intelligence. These applications showcase how streaming transforms static AI interactions into dynamic, agent-driven experiences that feel genuinely intelligent and proactive.

In a video of the [Shopper's Concierge demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwHPYyw7u6U), the multimodal, bi-directional streaming feature significantly improve the user experience of e-commerce by enabling a faster and more intuitive shopping experience. The combination of conversational understanding and rapid, parallelized searching culminates in advanced capabilities like virtual try-on, boosting buyer confidence and reducing the friction of online shopping.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Also, you can think of many possible real-world applications for bidirectional streaming:

1. **Customer Service & Contact Centers**: This is the most direct application. The technology can create sophisticated virtual agents that go far beyond traditional chatbots.

    - **Use case**: A customer calls a retail company's support line about a defective product.
    - **Multimodality (video)**: The customer can say, "My coffee machine is leaking from the bottom, let me show you." They can then use their phone's camera to stream live video of the issue. The AI agent can use its vision capabilities to identify the model and the specific point of failure.
    - **Live Interaction & Interruption**: If the agent says, "Okay, I'm processing a return for your Model X coffee maker," the customer can interrupt with, "No, wait, it's the Model Y Pro," and the agent can immediately correct its course without restarting the conversation.

1. **Field Service & Technical Assistance**: Technicians working on-site can use a hands-free, voice-activated assistant to get real-time help.

    - **Use Case**: An HVAC technician is on-site trying to diagnose a complex commercial air conditioning unit.
    - **Multimodality (Video & Voice)**: The technician, wearing smart glasses or using a phone, can stream their point-of-view to the AI agent. They can ask, "I'm hearing a strange noise from this compressor. Can you identify it and pull up the diagnostic flowchart for this model?"
    - **Live Interaction**: The agent can guide the technician step-by-step, and the technician can ask clarifying questions or interrupt at any point without taking their hands off their tools.

1. **Healthcare & Telemedicine**: The agent can serve as a first point of contact for patient intake, triage, and basic consultations.

    - **Use Case**: A patient uses a provider's app for a preliminary consultation about a skin condition.
    - **Multimodality (Video/Image)**: The patient can securely share a live video or high-resolution image of a rash. The AI can perform a preliminary analysis and ask clarifying questions.

1. **Financial Services & Wealth Management**: An agent can provide clients with a secure, interactive, and data-rich way to manage their finances.

    - **Use Case**: A client wants to review their investment portfolio and discuss market trends.
    - **Multimodality (Screen Sharing)**: The agent can share its screen to display charts, graphs, and portfolio performance data. The client could also share their screen to point to a specific news article and ask, "What is the potential impact of this event on my tech stocks?"
    - **Live Interaction**: Analyze the client's current portfolio allocation by accessing their account data.Simulate the impact of a potential trade on the portfolio's risk profile.

## 1.2 ADK Bidi-streaming Architecture Overview { #adk-bidi-streaming-architecture-overview }

ADK Bidi-streaming architecture enables bidirectional AI conversations feel as natural as human dialogue. The architecture seamlessly integrates with Google's [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) through a sophisticated pipeline that has been designed for low latency and high-throughput communication.

The system handles the complex orchestration required for real-time streaming—managing multiple concurrent data flows, handling interruptions gracefully, processing multimodal inputs simultaneously, and maintaining conversation state across dynamic interactions. ADK Bidi-streaming abstracts this complexity into simple, intuitive APIs that developers can use without needing to understand the intricate details of streaming protocols or AI model communication patterns.

## 1.3 Setting Up Your Development Environment { #setting-up-your-development-environment }

Now that you understand the gist of ADK Bidi-streaming architecture and the value it provides, it's time to get hands-on experience. This section will prepare your development environment so you can start building the streaming agents and applications described in the previous sections.

By the end of this setup, you'll have everything needed to create the intelligent voice assistants, proactive customer support agents, and multi-agent collaboration platforms we've discussed. The setup process is straightforward—ADK handles the complex streaming infrastructure, so you can focus on building your agent's unique capabilities rather than wrestling with low-level streaming protocols.

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended) { #create-virtual-environment-recommended }

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# macOS/Linux:

```

#### 2. Install ADK { #install-adk }

Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root. Note that `google-adk` library includes FastAPI and uvicorn that you can use as the web server for bidi-streaming applications.

```txt
google-adk==1.3.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Set SSL Certificate Path (macOS only) { #set-ssl-certificate-path-macos-only }

```bash
# Required for proper SSL handling on macOS
export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)
```

#### 4. Set Up API Keys { #set-up-api-keys }

Choose your preferred platform for running agents:

=== "Google AI Studio"

    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    2. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```

=== "Google Cloud Vertex AI"

    1. Set up [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp)
    2. Install and configure [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
    3. Authenticate: `gcloud auth login`

    ```

#### 5. Create Environment Setup Script { #create-environment-setup-script }

We will create the validation script that will verify your installation:

```bash
# Create the directory structure
mkdir -p src/part1
```

Create `src/part1/1-3-1_environment_setup.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

### Project Structure

Now your streaming project should now have this structure:

```text
your-streaming-project/
├── .env                              # Environment variables (API keys)
├── requirements.txt                 # Python dependencies
└── src/
    └── part1/
        └── 1-3-1_environment_setup.py  # Environment validation script
```

### Run It

Use our complete environment setup script to ensure everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python src/part1/1-3-1_environment_setup.py
```

!!! example "Expected Output"

    When you run the validation script, you should see output similar to this:

    ```
    🔧 ADK Streaming Environment Validation
    =============================================
    ✓ Environment file loaded: /path/to/your-streaming-project/.env
    ✓ Python version: 3.12.8
    ✓ ADK import successful
    ✓ ADK version: 1.3.0
    ✓ Import: google.adk.agents
    ✓ Import: google.adk.runners
    ✓ Import: google.genai.types
    ✓ Platform configuration: FALSE
    ✓ API authentication: AIzaSyAolZ...
    ✓ Basic ADK functionality test passed

    🎉 Environment validation successful!
    ```

    This comprehensive validation script checks:

    - ADK installation and version
    - Required environment variables
    - API key validation
    - Basic import verification

### Next Steps

With your environment set up, you're ready to dive into the core streaming APIs. In the next part (coming soon), You'll learn about:

- **LiveRequestQueue**: The heart of bidirectional communication
- **run_live() method**: Starting streaming sessions
- **Event processing**: Handling real-time responses
- **Gemini Live API**: Direct integration patterns

# Configurating streaming behaviour

There are some configurations you can set for live(streaming) agents. 

It's set by [RunConfig](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/agents/run_config.py). You should use RunConfig with your [Runner.run_live(...)](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/runners.py). 

For example, if you want to set voice config, you can leverage speech_config. 

```python
voice_config = genai_types.VoiceConfig(
    prebuilt_voice_config=genai_types.PrebuiltVoiceConfigDict(
        voice_name='Aoede'
    )
)
speech_config = genai_types.SpeechConfig(voice_config=voice_config)
run_config = RunConfig(speech_config=speech_config)

runner.run_live(
    ...,
    run_config=run_config,
)
```

# Custom Audio Streaming app (WebSocket) {#custom-streaming-websocket}

This article overviews the server and client code for a custom asynchronous web app built with ADK Streaming and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), enabling real-time, bidirectional audio and text communication with WebSockets.

**Note:** This guide assumes you have experience of JavaScript and Python `asyncio` programming.

## Supported models for voice/video streaming {#supported-models}

In order to use voice/video streaming in ADK, you will need to use Gemini models that support the Live API. You can find the **model ID(s)** that supports the Gemini Live API in the documentation:

- [Google AI Studio: Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#live-api)
- [Vertex AI: Gemini Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)

There is also a [SSE](custom-streaming.md) version of the sample is available.

## 1. Install ADK {#1.-setup-installation}

Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):

```bash
# Create
python -m venv .venv
# Activate (each new terminal)
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD: .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install ADK:

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-adk==1.10.0
```

Set `SSL_CERT_FILE` variable with the following command.

```shell
export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)
```

Download the sample code:

```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/google/adk-docs.git
cd adk-docs
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set examples/python/snippets/streaming/adk-streaming-ws
git checkout main
cd examples/python/snippets/streaming/adk-streaming-ws/app
```

This sample code has the following files and folders:

```console
adk-streaming-ws/
└── app/ # the web app folder
    ├── .env # Gemini API key / Google Cloud Project ID
    ├── main.py # FastAPI web app
    ├── static/ # Static content folder
    |   ├── js # JavaScript files folder (includes app.js)
    |   └── index.html # The web client page
    └── google_search_agent/ # Agent folder
        ├── __init__.py # Python package
        └── agent.py # Agent definition
```

## 2\. Set up the platform {#2.-set-up-the-platform}

To run the sample app, choose a platform from either Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI:

=== "Gemini - Google AI Studio"
    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2. Open the **`.env`** file located inside (`app/`) and copy-paste the following code.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

    3. Replace `PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual `API KEY`.

=== "Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI"
    1. You need an existing
       [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?e=48754805&hl=en) account and a
       project.
        * Set up a
          [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp)
        * Set up the
          [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
        * Authenticate to Google Cloud, from the terminal by running
          `gcloud auth login`.
        * [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).
    2. Open the **`.env`** file located inside (`app/`). Copy-paste
       the following code and update the project ID and location.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
        ```


### agent.py

The agent definition code `agent.py` in the `google_search_agent` folder is where the agent's logic is written:


```py
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search  # Import the tool

root_agent = Agent(
   name="google_search_agent",
   model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp", # if this model does not work, try below
   #model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-001",
   description="Agent to answer questions using Google Search.",
   instruction="Answer the question using the Google Search tool.",
   tools=[google_search],
)
```

**Note:**  To enable both text and audio/video input, the model must support the generateContent (for text) and bidiGenerateContent methods. Verify these capabilities by referring to the [List Models Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/api/models#method:-models.list). This quickstart utilizes the gemini-2.0-flash-exp model for demonstration purposes.

Notice how easily you integrated [grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding?lang=python#configure-search) capabilities.  The `Agent` class and the `google_search` tool handle the complex interactions with the LLM and grounding with the search API, allowing you to focus on the agent's *purpose* and *behavior*.

![intro_components.png](../assets/quickstart-streaming-tool.png)

## 3\. Interact with Your Streaming app {#3.-interact-with-your-streaming-app}

1\. **Navigate to the Correct Directory:**

   To run your agent effectively, make sure you are in the **app folder (`adk-streaming-ws/app`)**

2\. **Start the Fast API**: Run the following command to start CLI interface with

```console
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3\. **Access the app with the text mode:** Once the app starts, the terminal will display a local URL (e.g., [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)). Click this link to open the UI in your browser.

Now you should see the UI like this:

![ADK Streaming app](../assets/adk-streaming-text.png)

Try asking a question `What time is it now?`. The agent will use Google Search to respond to your queries. You would notice that the UI shows the agent's response as streaming text. You can also send messages to the agent at any time, even while the agent is still responding. This demonstrates the bidirectional communication capability of ADK Streaming.

4\. **Access the app with the audio mode:** Now click the `Start Audio` button. The app reconnects with the server in an audio mode, and the UI will show the following dialog for the first time:

![ADK Streaming app](../assets/adk-streaming-audio-dialog.png)

Click `Allow while visiting the site`, then you will see the microphone icon will be shown at the top of the browser:

![ADK Streaming app](../assets/adk-streaming-mic.png)

Now you can talk to the agent with voice. Ask questions like `What time is it now?` with voice and you will hear the agent responding in voice too. As Streaming for ADK supports [multiple languages](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live#supported-languages), it can also respond to question in the supported languages.

5\. **Check console logs**

If you are using the Chrome browser, use the right click and select `Inspect` to open the DevTools. On the `Console`, you can see the incoming and outgoing audio data such as `[CLIENT TO AGENT]` and `[AGENT TO CLIENT]`, representing the audio data streaming in and out between the browser and the server.

At the same time, in the app server console, you should see something like this:

```
INFO:     ('127.0.0.1', 50068) - "WebSocket /ws/70070018?is_audio=true" [accepted]
Client #70070018 connected, audio mode: true
INFO:     connection open
INFO:     127.0.0.1:50061 - "GET /static/js/pcm-player-processor.js HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:50060 - "GET /static/js/pcm-recorder-processor.js HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 9600 bytes.
INFO:     127.0.0.1:50082 - "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 11520 bytes.
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: 11520 bytes.
```

These console logs are important in case you develop your own streaming application. In many cases, the communication failure between the browser and server becomes a major cause for the streaming application bugs.

6\. **Troubleshooting tips**

- **When `ws://` doesn't work:** If you see any errors on the Chrome DevTools with regard to `ws://` connection, try replacing `ws://` with `wss://` on `app/static/js/app.js` at line 28. This may happen when you are running the sample on a cloud environment and using a proxy connection to connect from your browser.
- **When `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model doesn't work:** If you see any errors on the app server console with regard to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model availability, try replacing it with `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` on `app/google_search_agent/agent.py` at line 6.

## 4. Server code overview {#4.-server-side-code-overview}

This server app enables real-time, streaming interaction with ADK agent via WebSockets. Clients send text/audio to the ADK agent and receive streamed text/audio responses.

Core functions:
1.  Initialize/manage ADK agent sessions.
2.  Handle client WebSocket connections.
3.  Relay client messages to the ADK agent.
4.  Stream ADK agent responses (text/audio) to clients.

### ADK Streaming Setup

```py
import os
import json
import asyncio
import base64

from pathlib import Path
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from google.genai.types import (
    Part,
    Content,
    Blob,
)

from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.agents import LiveRequestQueue
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
from google.adk.sessions.in_memory_session_service import InMemorySessionService

from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

from google_search_agent.agent import root_agent
```

*   **Imports:** Includes standard Python libraries, `dotenv` for environment variables, Google ADK, and FastAPI.
*   **`load_dotenv()`:** Loads environment variables.
*   **`APP_NAME`**: Application identifier for ADK.
*   **`session_service = InMemorySessionService()`**: Initializes an in-memory ADK session service, suitable for single-instance or development use. Production might use a persistent store.

### `start_agent_session(session_id, is_audio=False)`

```py
async def start_agent_session(user_id, is_audio=False):
    """Starts an agent session"""

    # Create a Runner
    runner = InMemoryRunner(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        agent=root_agent,
    )

    # Create a Session
    session = await runner.session_service.create_session(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        user_id=user_id,  # Replace with actual user ID
    )

    # Set response modality
    modality = "AUDIO" if is_audio else "TEXT"
    run_config = RunConfig(response_modalities=[modality])
    
    # Optional: Enable session resumption for improved reliability
    # run_config = RunConfig(
    #     response_modalities=[modality],
    #     session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
    # )

    # Create a LiveRequestQueue for this session
    live_request_queue = LiveRequestQueue()

    # Start agent session
    live_events = runner.run_live(
        session=session,
        live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
        run_config=run_config,
    )
    return live_events, live_request_queue
```

This function initializes an ADK agent live session.

| Parameter    | Type    | Description                                             |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `user_id` | `str`   | Unique client identifier.                       |
| `is_audio`   | `bool`  | `True` for audio responses, `False` for text (default). |

**Key Steps:**
1\.  **Create Runner:** Instantiates the ADK runner for the `root_agent`.
2\.  **Create Session:** Establishes an ADK session.
3\.  **Set Response Modality:** Configures agent response as "AUDIO" or "TEXT".
4\.  **Create LiveRequestQueue:** Creates a queue for client inputs to the agent.
5\.  **Start Agent Session:** `runner.run_live(...)` starts the agent, returning:
    *   `live_events`: Asynchronous iterable for agent events (text, audio, completion).
    *   `live_request_queue`: Queue to send data to the agent.

**Returns:** `(live_events, live_request_queue)`.

### Session Resumption Configuration

ADK supports live session resumption to improve reliability during streaming conversations. This feature enables automatic reconnection when live connections are interrupted due to network issues.

#### Enabling Session Resumption

To enable session resumption, you need to:

1. **Import the required types**:
```py
from google.genai import types
```

2. **Configure session resumption in RunConfig**:
```py
run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=[modality],
    session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)
```

#### Session Resumption Features

- **Automatic Handle Caching** - The system automatically caches session resumption handles during live conversations
- **Transparent Reconnection** - When connections are interrupted, the system attempts to resume using cached handles
- **Context Preservation** - Conversation context and state are maintained across reconnections
- **Network Resilience** - Provides better user experience during unstable network conditions

#### Implementation Notes

- Session resumption handles are managed internally by the ADK framework
- No additional client-side code changes are required
- The feature is particularly beneficial for long-running streaming conversations
- Connection interruptions become less disruptive to the user experience

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors with session resumption:

1. **Check model compatibility** - Ensure you're using a model that supports session resumption
2. **API limitations** - Some session resumption features may not be available in all API versions
3. **Remove session resumption** - If issues persist, you can disable session resumption by removing the `session_resumption` parameter from `RunConfig`

### `agent_to_client_messaging(websocket, live_events)`

```py

async def agent_to_client_messaging(websocket, live_events):
    """Agent to client communication"""
    while True:
        async for event in live_events:

            # If the turn complete or interrupted, send it
            if event.turn_complete or event.interrupted:
                message = {
                    "turn_complete": event.turn_complete,
                    "interrupted": event.interrupted,
                }
                await websocket.send_text(json.dumps(message))
                print(f"[AGENT TO CLIENT]: {message}")
                continue

            # Read the Content and its first Part
            part: Part = (
                event.content and event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0]
            )
            if not part:
                continue

            # If it's audio, send Base64 encoded audio data
            is_audio = part.inline_data and part.inline_data.mime_type.startswith("audio/pcm")
            if is_audio:
                audio_data = part.inline_data and part.inline_data.data
                if audio_data:
                    message = {
                        "mime_type": "audio/pcm",
                        "data": base64.b64encode(audio_data).decode("ascii")
                    }
                    await websocket.send_text(json.dumps(message))
                    print(f"[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: {len(audio_data)} bytes.")
                    continue

            # If it's text and a parial text, send it
            if part.text and event.partial:
                message = {
                    "mime_type": "text/plain",
                    "data": part.text
                }
                await websocket.send_text(json.dumps(message))
                print(f"[AGENT TO CLIENT]: text/plain: {message}")
```

This asynchronous function streams ADK agent events to the WebSocket client.

**Logic:**
1.  Iterates through `live_events` from the agent.
2.  **Turn Completion/Interruption:** Sends status flags to the client.
3.  **Content Processing:**
    *   Extracts the first `Part` from event content.
    *   **Audio Data:** If audio (PCM), Base64 encodes and sends it as JSON: `{ "mime_type": "audio/pcm", "data": "<base64_audio>" }`.
    *   **Text Data:** If partial text, sends it as JSON: `{ "mime_type": "text/plain", "data": "<partial_text>" }`.
4.  Logs messages.

### `client_to_agent_messaging(websocket, live_request_queue)`

```py

async def client_to_agent_messaging(websocket, live_request_queue):
    """Client to agent communication"""
    while True:
        # Decode JSON message
        message_json = await websocket.receive_text()
        message = json.loads(message_json)
        mime_type = message["mime_type"]
        data = message["data"]

        # Send the message to the agent
        if mime_type == "text/plain":
            # Send a text message
            content = Content(role="user", parts=[Part.from_text(text=data)])
            live_request_queue.send_content(content=content)
            print(f"[CLIENT TO AGENT]: {data}")
        elif mime_type == "audio/pcm":
            # Send an audio data
            decoded_data = base64.b64decode(data)
            live_request_queue.send_realtime(Blob(data=decoded_data, mime_type=mime_type))
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Mime type not supported: {mime_type}")
```

This asynchronous function relays messages from the WebSocket client to the ADK agent.

**Logic:**
1.  Receives and parses JSON messages from the WebSocket, expecting: `{ "mime_type": "text/plain" | "audio/pcm", "data": "<data>" }`.
2.  **Text Input:** For "text/plain", sends `Content` to agent via `live_request_queue.send_content()`.
3.  **Audio Input:** For "audio/pcm", decodes Base64 data, wraps in `Blob`, and sends via `live_request_queue.send_realtime()`.
4.  Raises `ValueError` for unsupported MIME types.
5.  Logs messages.

### FastAPI Web Application

```py

app = FastAPI()

STATIC_DIR = Path("static")
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory=STATIC_DIR), name="static")


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    """Serves the index.html"""
    return FileResponse(os.path.join(STATIC_DIR, "index.html"))


@app.websocket("/ws/{user_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, user_id: int, is_audio: str):
    """Client websocket endpoint"""

    # Wait for client connection
    await websocket.accept()
    print(f"Client #{user_id} connected, audio mode: {is_audio}")

    # Start agent session
    user_id_str = str(user_id)
    live_events, live_request_queue = await start_agent_session(user_id_str, is_audio == "true")

    # Start tasks
    agent_to_client_task = asyncio.create_task(
        agent_to_client_messaging(websocket, live_events)
    )
    client_to_agent_task = asyncio.create_task(
        client_to_agent_messaging(websocket, live_request_queue)
    )

    # Wait until the websocket is disconnected or an error occurs
    tasks = [agent_to_client_task, client_to_agent_task]
    await asyncio.wait(tasks, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_EXCEPTION)

    # Close LiveRequestQueue
    live_request_queue.close()

    # Disconnected
    print(f"Client #{user_id} disconnected")

```

*   **`app = FastAPI()`**: Initializes the application.
*   **Static Files:** Serves files from the `static` directory under `/static`.
*   **`@app.get("/")` (Root Endpoint):** Serves `index.html`.
*   **`@app.websocket("/ws/{user_id}")` (WebSocket Endpoint):**
    *   **Path Parameters:** `user_id` (int) and `is_audio` (str: "true"/"false").
    *   **Connection Handling:**
        1.  Accepts WebSocket connection.
        2.  Calls `start_agent_session()` using `user_id` and `is_audio`.
        3.  **Concurrent Messaging Tasks:** Creates and runs `agent_to_client_messaging` and `client_to_agent_messaging` concurrently using `asyncio.gather`. These tasks handle bidirectional message flow.
        4.  Logs client connection and disconnection.

### How It Works (Overall Flow)

1.  Client connects to `ws://<server>/ws/<user_id>?is_audio=<true_or_false>`.
2.  Server's `websocket_endpoint` accepts, starts ADK session (`start_agent_session`).
3.  Two `asyncio` tasks manage communication:
    *   `client_to_agent_messaging`: Client WebSocket messages -> ADK `live_request_queue`.
    *   `agent_to_client_messaging`: ADK `live_events` -> Client WebSocket.
4.  Bidirectional streaming continues until disconnection or error.

## 5. Client code overview {#5.-client-side-code-overview}

The JavaScript `app.js` (in `app/static/js`) manages client-side interaction with the ADK Streaming WebSocket backend. It handles sending text/audio and receiving/displaying streamed responses.

Key functionalities:
1.  Manage WebSocket connection.
2.  Handle text input.
3.  Capture microphone audio (Web Audio API, AudioWorklets).
4.  Send text/audio to backend.
5.  Receive and render text/audio agent responses.
6.  Manage UI.

### Prerequisites

*   **HTML Structure:** Requires specific element IDs (e.g., `messageForm`, `message`, `messages`, `sendButton`, `startAudioButton`).
*   **Backend Server:** The Python FastAPI server must be running.
*   **Audio Worklet Files:** `audio-player.js` and `audio-recorder.js` for audio processing.

### WebSocket Handling

```JavaScript

// Connect the server with a WebSocket connection
const sessionId = Math.random().toString().substring(10);
const ws_url =
  "ws://" + window.location.host + "/ws/" + sessionId;
let websocket = null;
let is_audio = false;

// Get DOM elements
const messageForm = document.getElementById("messageForm");
const messageInput = document.getElementById("message");
const messagesDiv = document.getElementById("messages");
let currentMessageId = null;

// WebSocket handlers
function connectWebsocket() {
  // Connect websocket
  websocket = new WebSocket(ws_url + "?is_audio=" + is_audio);

  // Handle connection open
  websocket.onopen = function () {
    // Connection opened messages
    console.log("WebSocket connection opened.");
    document.getElementById("messages").textContent = "Connection opened";

    // Enable the Send button
    document.getElementById("sendButton").disabled = false;
    addSubmitHandler();
  };

  // Handle incoming messages
  websocket.onmessage = function (event) {
    // Parse the incoming message
    const message_from_server = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log("[AGENT TO CLIENT] ", message_from_server);

    // Check if the turn is complete
    // if turn complete, add new message
    if (
      message_from_server.turn_complete &&
      message_from_server.turn_complete == true
    ) {
      currentMessageId = null;
      return;
    }

    // If it's audio, play it
    if (message_from_server.mime_type == "audio/pcm" && audioPlayerNode) {
      audioPlayerNode.port.postMessage(base64ToArray(message_from_server.data));
    }

    // If it's a text, print it
    if (message_from_server.mime_type == "text/plain") {
      // add a new message for a new turn
      if (currentMessageId == null) {
        currentMessageId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
        const message = document.createElement("p");
        message.id = currentMessageId;
        // Append the message element to the messagesDiv
        messagesDiv.appendChild(message);
      }

      // Add message text to the existing message element
      const message = document.getElementById(currentMessageId);
      message.textContent += message_from_server.data;

      // Scroll down to the bottom of the messagesDiv
      messagesDiv.scrollTop = messagesDiv.scrollHeight;
    }
  };

  // Handle connection close
  websocket.onclose = function () {
    console.log("WebSocket connection closed.");
    document.getElementById("sendButton").disabled = true;
    document.getElementById("messages").textContent = "Connection closed";
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log("Reconnecting...");
      connectWebsocket();
    }, 5000);
  };

  websocket.onerror = function (e) {
    console.log("WebSocket error: ", e);
  };
}
connectWebsocket();

// Add submit handler to the form
function addSubmitHandler() {
  messageForm.onsubmit = function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const message = messageInput.value;
    if (message) {
      const p = document.createElement("p");
      p.textContent = "> " + message;
      messagesDiv.appendChild(p);
      messageInput.value = "";
      sendMessage({
        mime_type: "text/plain",
        data: message,
      });
      console.log("[CLIENT TO AGENT] " + message);
    }
    return false;
  };
}

// Send a message to the server as a JSON string
function sendMessage(message) {
  if (websocket && websocket.readyState == WebSocket.OPEN) {
    const messageJson = JSON.stringify(message);
    websocket.send(messageJson);
  }
}

// Decode Base64 data to Array
function base64ToArray(base64) {
  const binaryString = window.atob(base64);
  const len = binaryString.length;
  const bytes = new Uint8Array(len);
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    bytes[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return bytes.buffer;
}
```

*   **Connection Setup:** Generates `sessionId`, constructs `ws_url`. `is_audio` flag (initially `false`) appends `?is_audio=true` to URL when active. `connectWebsocket()` initializes the connection.
*   **`websocket.onopen`**: Enables send button, updates UI, calls `addSubmitHandler()`.
*   **`websocket.onmessage`**: Parses incoming JSON from server.
    *   **Turn Completion:** Resets `currentMessageId` if agent turn is complete.
    *   **Audio Data (`audio/pcm`):** Decodes Base64 audio (`base64ToArray()`) and sends to `audioPlayerNode` for playback.
    *   **Text Data (`text/plain`):** If new turn (`currentMessageId` is null), creates new `<p>`. Appends received text to the current message paragraph for streaming effect. Scrolls `messagesDiv`.
*   **`websocket.onclose`**: Disables send button, updates UI, attempts auto-reconnection after 5s.
*   **`websocket.onerror`**: Logs errors.
*   **Initial Connection:** `connectWebsocket()` is called on script load.

#### DOM Interaction & Message Submission

*   **Element Retrieval:** Fetches required DOM elements.
*   **`addSubmitHandler()`**: Attached to `messageForm`'s submit. Prevents default submission, gets text from `messageInput`, displays user message, clears input, and calls `sendMessage()` with `{ mime_type: "text/plain", data: messageText }`.
*   **`sendMessage(messagePayload)`**: Sends JSON stringified `messagePayload` if WebSocket is open.

### Audio Handling

```JavaScript

let audioPlayerNode;
let audioPlayerContext;
let audioRecorderNode;
let audioRecorderContext;
let micStream;

// Import the audio worklets
import { startAudioPlayerWorklet } from "./audio-player.js";
import { startAudioRecorderWorklet } from "./audio-recorder.js";

// Start audio
function startAudio() {
  // Start audio output
  startAudioPlayerWorklet().then(([node, ctx]) => {
    audioPlayerNode = node;
    audioPlayerContext = ctx;
  });
  // Start audio input
  startAudioRecorderWorklet(audioRecorderHandler).then(
    ([node, ctx, stream]) => {
      audioRecorderNode = node;
      audioRecorderContext = ctx;
      micStream = stream;
    }
  );
}

// Start the audio only when the user clicked the button
// (due to the gesture requirement for the Web Audio API)
const startAudioButton = document.getElementById("startAudioButton");
startAudioButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  startAudioButton.disabled = true;
  startAudio();
  is_audio = true;
  connectWebsocket(); // reconnect with the audio mode
});

// Audio recorder handler
function audioRecorderHandler(pcmData) {
  // Send the pcm data as base64
  sendMessage({
    mime_type: "audio/pcm",
    data: arrayBufferToBase64(pcmData),
  });
  console.log("[CLIENT TO AGENT] sent %s bytes", pcmData.byteLength);
}

// Encode an array buffer with Base64
function arrayBufferToBase64(buffer) {
  let binary = "";
  const bytes = new Uint8Array(buffer);
  const len = bytes.byteLength;
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    binary += String.fromCharCode(bytes[i]);
  }
  return window.btoa(binary);
}
```

*   **Audio Worklets:** Uses `AudioWorkletNode` via `audio-player.js` (for playback) and `audio-recorder.js` (for capture).
*   **State Variables:** Store AudioContexts and WorkletNodes (e.g., `audioPlayerNode`).
*   **`startAudio()`**: Initializes player and recorder worklets. Passes `audioRecorderHandler` as callback to recorder.
*   **"Start Audio" Button (`startAudioButton`):**
    *   Requires user gesture for Web Audio API.
    *   On click: disables button, calls `startAudio()`, sets `is_audio = true`, then calls `connectWebsocket()` to reconnect in audio mode (URL includes `?is_audio=true`).
*   **`audioRecorderHandler(pcmData)`**: Callback from recorder worklet with PCM audio chunks. Encodes `pcmData` to Base64 (`arrayBufferToBase64()`) and sends to server via `sendMessage()` with `mime_type: "audio/pcm"`.
*   **Helper Functions:** `base64ToArray()` (server audio -> client player) and `arrayBufferToBase64()` (client mic audio -> server).

### How It Works (Client-Side Flow)

1.  **Page Load:** Establishes WebSocket in text mode.
2.  **Text Interaction:** User types/submits text; sent to server. Server text responses displayed, streamed.
3.  **Switching to Audio Mode:** "Start Audio" button click initializes audio worklets, sets `is_audio=true`, and reconnects WebSocket in audio mode.
4.  **Audio Interaction:** Recorder sends mic audio (Base64 PCM) to server. Server audio/text responses handled by `websocket.onmessage` for playback/display.
5.  **Connection Management:** Auto-reconnect on WebSocket close.


## Summary

This article overviews the server and client code for a custom asynchronous web app built with ADK Streaming and FastAPI, enabling real-time, bidirectional voice and text communication.

The Python FastAPI server code initializes ADK agent sessions, configured for text or audio responses. It uses a WebSocket endpoint to handle client connections. Asynchronous tasks manage bidirectional messaging: forwarding client text or Base64-encoded PCM audio to the ADK agent, and streaming text or Base64-encoded PCM audio responses from the agent back to the client.

The client-side JavaScript code manages a WebSocket connection, which can be re-established to switch between text and audio modes. It sends user input (text or microphone audio captured via Web Audio API and AudioWorklets) to the server. Incoming messages from the server are processed: text is displayed (streamed), and Base64-encoded PCM audio is decoded and played using an AudioWorklet.

### Next steps for production

When you will use the Streaming for ADK in production apps, you may want to consinder the following points:

*   **Deploy Multiple Instances:** Run several instances of your FastAPI application instead of a single one.
*   **Implement Load Balancing:** Place a load balancer in front of your application instances to distribute incoming WebSocket connections.
    *   **Configure for WebSockets:** Ensure the load balancer supports long-lived WebSocket connections and consider "sticky sessions" (session affinity) to route a client to the same backend instance, *or* design for stateless instances (see next point).
*   **Externalize Session State:** Replace the `InMemorySessionService` for ADK with a distributed, persistent session store. This allows any server instance to handle any user's session, enabling true statelessness at the application server level and improving fault tolerance.
*   **Implement Health Checks:** Set up robust health checks for your WebSocket server instances so the load balancer can automatically remove unhealthy instances from rotation.
*   **Utilize Orchestration:** Consider using an orchestration platform like Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, self-healing, and management of your WebSocket server instances.

# Custom Audio Streaming app (SSE) {#custom-streaming}

This article overviews the server and client code for a custom asynchronous web app built with ADK Streaming and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), enabling real-time, bidirectional audio and text communication with Server-Sent Events (SSE). The key features are:

**Server-Side (Python/FastAPI)**:
- FastAPI + ADK integration
- Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming
- Session management with isolated user contexts
- Support for both text and audio communication modes
- Google Search tool integration for grounded responses

**Client-Side (JavaScript/Web Audio API)**:
- Real-time bidirectional communication via SSE and HTTP POST
- Professional audio processing using AudioWorklet processors
- Seamless mode switching between text and audio
- Automatic reconnection and error handling
- Base64 encoding for audio data transmission

There is also a [WebSocket](custom-streaming-ws.md) version of the sample is available.

```

## 2\. Set up the platform {#2.-set-up-the-platform}

To run the sample app, choose a platform from either Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI:

=== "Gemini - Google AI Studio"
    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    2. Open the **`.env`** file located inside (`app/`) and copy-paste the following code.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

    3. Replace `PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual `API KEY`.

=== "Gemini - Google Cloud Vertex AI"
    1. You need an existing
       [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?e=48754805&hl=en) account and a
       project.
        * Set up a
          [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp)
        * Set up the
          [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
        * Authenticate to Google Cloud, from the terminal by running
          `gcloud auth login`.
        * [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).
    2. Open the **`.env`** file located inside (`app/`). Copy-paste
       the following code and update the project ID and location.

        ```env title=".env"
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID
        GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
        ```


## 3\. Interact with Your Streaming app {#3.-interact-with-your-streaming-app}

1\. **Navigate to the Correct Directory:**

   To run your agent effectively, make sure you are in the **app folder (`adk-streaming/app`)**

2\. **Start the Fast API**: Run the following command to start CLI interface with

```console
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3\. **Access the app with the text mode:** Once the app starts, the terminal will display a local URL (e.g., [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)). Click this link to open the UI in your browser.

Now you should see the UI like this:

![ADK Streaming app](../assets/adk-streaming-text.png)

Try asking a question `What time is it now?`. The agent will use Google Search to respond to your queries. You would notice that the UI shows the agent's response as streaming text. You can also send messages to the agent at any time, even while the agent is still responding. This demonstrates the bidirectional communication capability of ADK Streaming.

4\. **Access the app with the audio mode:** Now click the `Start Audio` button. The app reconnects with the server in an audio mode, and the UI will show the following dialog for the first time:

![ADK Streaming app](../assets/adk-streaming-audio-dialog.png)

Click `Allow while visiting the site`, then you will see the microphone icon will be shown at the top of the browser:

![ADK Streaming app](../assets/adk-streaming-mic.png)

Now you can talk to the agent with voice. Ask questions like `What time is it now?` with voice and you will hear the agent responding in voice too. As Streaming for ADK supports [multiple languages](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live#supported-languages), it can also respond to question in the supported languages.

5\. **Check console logs**

If you are using the Chrome browser, use the right click and select `Inspect` to open the DevTools. On the `Console`, you can see the incoming and outgoing audio data such as `[CLIENT TO AGENT]` and `[AGENT TO CLIENT]`, representing the audio data streaming in and out between the browser and the server.

At the same time, in the app server console, you should see something like this:

```
Client #90766266 connected via SSE, audio mode: false
INFO:     127.0.0.1:52692 - "GET /events/90766266?is_audio=false HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
[CLIENT TO AGENT]: hi
INFO:     127.0.0.1:52696 - "POST /send/90766266 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: text/plain: {'mime_type': 'text/plain', 'data': 'Hi'}
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: text/plain: {'mime_type': 'text/plain', 'data': ' there! How can I help you today?\n'}
[AGENT TO CLIENT]: {'turn_complete': True, 'interrupted': None}
```

These console logs are important in case you develop your own streaming application. In many cases, the communication failure between the browser and server becomes a major cause for the streaming application bugs.

6\. **Troubleshooting tips**

- **When your browser can't connect to the server via SSH proxy:** SSH proxy used in various cloud services may not work with SSE. Please try without SSH proxy, such as using a local laptop, or try the [WebSocket](custom-streaming-ws.md) version.
- **When `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model doesn't work:** If you see any errors on the app server console with regard to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model availability, try replacing it with `gemini-2.0-flash-live-001` on `app/google_search_agent/agent.py` at line 6.

## 4. Agent definition

The agent definition code `agent.py` in the `google_search_agent` folder is where the agent's logic is written:


```py
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search  # Import the tool

root_agent = Agent(
   name="google_search_agent",
   model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp", # if this model does not work, try below
   #model="gemini-2.0-flash-live-001",
   description="Agent to answer questions using Google Search.",
   instruction="Answer the question using the Google Search tool.",
   tools=[google_search],
)
```

Notice how easily you integrated [grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding?lang=python#configure-search) capabilities.  The `Agent` class and the `google_search` tool handle the complex interactions with the LLM and grounding with the search API, allowing you to focus on the agent's *purpose* and *behavior*.

The server and client architecture enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and AI agents with proper session isolation and resource management.

## 5. Server side code overview {#5.-server-side-code-overview}

The FastAPI server provides real-time communication between web clients and the AI agent.

### Bidirectional communication overview {#4.-bidi-comm-overview}

#### Client-to-Agent Flow:
1. **Connection Establishment** - Client opens SSE connection to `/events/{user_id}`, triggering session creation and storing request queue in `active_sessions`
2. **Message Transmission** - Client sends POST to `/send/{user_id}` with JSON payload containing `mime_type` and `data`
3. **Queue Processing** - Server retrieves session's `live_request_queue` and forwards message to agent via `send_content()` or `send_realtime()`

#### Agent-to-Client Flow:
1. **Event Generation** - Agent processes requests and generates events through `live_events` async generator
2. **Stream Processing** - `agent_to_client_sse()` filters events and formats them as SSE-compatible JSON
3. **Real-time Delivery** - Events stream to client via persistent HTTP connection with proper SSE headers

#### Session Management:
- **Per-User Isolation** - Each user gets unique session stored in `active_sessions` dict
- **Lifecycle Management** - Sessions auto-cleanup on disconnect with proper resource disposal
- **Concurrent Support** - Multiple users can have simultaneous active sessions

#### Error Handling:
- **Session Validation** - POST requests validate session existence before processing
- **Stream Resilience** - SSE streams handle exceptions and perform cleanup automatically
- **Connection Recovery** - Clients can reconnect by re-establishing SSE connection

#### Session Resumption:
- **Live Session Resumption** - Enables transparent reconnection to interrupted live conversations
- **Handle Caching** - System automatically caches session handles for recovery
- **Reliability Enhancement** - Improves resilience against network instability during streaming


### Agent Session Management

The `start_agent_session()` function creates isolated AI agent sessions:

```py
async def start_agent_session(user_id, is_audio=False):
    """Starts an agent session"""

    # Create a Runner
    runner = InMemoryRunner(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        agent=root_agent,
    )

    # Create a Session
    session = await runner.session_service.create_session(
        app_name=APP_NAME,
        user_id=user_id,  # Replace with actual user ID
    )

    # Set response modality
    modality = "AUDIO" if is_audio else "TEXT"
    run_config = RunConfig(response_modalities=[modality])
    
    # Optional: Enable session resumption for improved reliability
    # run_config = RunConfig(
    #     response_modalities=[modality],
    #     session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
    # )

    # Create a LiveRequestQueue for this session
    live_request_queue = LiveRequestQueue()

    # Start agent session
    live_events = runner.run_live(
        session=session,
        live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
        run_config=run_config,
    )
    return live_events, live_request_queue
```

- **InMemoryRunner Setup** - Creates a runner instance that manages the agent lifecycle in memory, with the app name "ADK Streaming example" and the Google Search agent.

- **Session Creation** - Uses `runner.session_service.create_session()` to establish a unique session per user ID, enabling multiple concurrent users.

- **Response Modality Configuration** - Sets `RunConfig` with either "AUDIO" or "TEXT" modality based on the `is_audio` parameter, determining output format.

- **LiveRequestQueue** - Creates a bidirectional communication channel that queues incoming requests and enables real-time message passing between client and agent.

- **Live Events Stream** - `runner.run_live()` returns an async generator that yields real-time events from the agent, including partial responses, turn completions, and interruptions.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming

The `agent_to_client_sse()` function handles real-time streaming from agent to client:

```py
async def agent_to_client_sse(live_events):
    """Agent to client communication via SSE"""
    async for event in live_events:
        # If the turn complete or interrupted, send it
        if event.turn_complete or event.interrupted:
            message = {
                "turn_complete": event.turn_complete,
                "interrupted": event.interrupted,
            }
            yield f"data: {json.dumps(message)}\n\n"
            print(f"[AGENT TO CLIENT]: {message}")
            continue

        # Read the Content and its first Part
        part: Part = (
            event.content and event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0]
        )
        if not part:
            continue

        # If it's audio, send Base64 encoded audio data
        is_audio = part.inline_data and part.inline_data.mime_type.startswith("audio/pcm")
        if is_audio:
            audio_data = part.inline_data and part.inline_data.data
            if audio_data:
                message = {
                    "mime_type": "audio/pcm",
                    "data": base64.b64encode(audio_data).decode("ascii")
                }
                yield f"data: {json.dumps(message)}\n\n"
                print(f"[AGENT TO CLIENT]: audio/pcm: {len(audio_data)} bytes.")
                continue

        # If it's text and a parial text, send it
        if part.text and event.partial:
            message = {
                "mime_type": "text/plain",
                "data": part.text
            }
            yield f"data: {json.dumps(message)}\n\n"
            print(f"[AGENT TO CLIENT]: text/plain: {message}")
```

- **Event Processing Loop** - Iterates through `live_events` async generator, processing each event as it arrives from the agent.

- **Turn Management**  - Detects conversation turn completion or interruption events and sends JSON messages with `turn_complete` and `interrupted` flags to signal conversation state changes.

- **Content Part Extraction** - Extracts the first `Part` from event content, which contains either text or audio data.

- **Audio Streaming**  - Handles PCM audio data by:
  - Detecting `audio/pcm` MIME type in `inline_data`
  - Base64 encoding raw audio bytes for JSON transmission
  - Sending with `mime_type` and `data` fields

- **Text Streaming**  - Processes partial text responses by sending incremental text updates as they're generated, enabling real-time typing effects.

- **SSE Format** - All data is formatted as `data: {json}\n\n` following SSE specification for browser EventSource API compatibility.

### HTTP Endpoints and Routing

#### Root Endpoint
**GET /** - Serves `static/index.html` as the main application interface using FastAPI's `FileResponse`.

#### SSE Events Endpoint

```py
@app.get("/events/{user_id}")
async def sse_endpoint(user_id: int, is_audio: str = "false"):
    """SSE endpoint for agent to client communication"""

    # Start agent session
    user_id_str = str(user_id)
    live_events, live_request_queue = await start_agent_session(user_id_str, is_audio == "true")

    # Store the request queue for this user
    active_sessions[user_id_str] = live_request_queue

    print(f"Client #{user_id} connected via SSE, audio mode: {is_audio}")

    def cleanup():
        live_request_queue.close()
        if user_id_str in active_sessions:
            del active_sessions[user_id_str]
        print(f"Client #{user_id} disconnected from SSE")

    async def event_generator():
        try:
            async for data in agent_to_client_sse(live_events):
                yield data
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in SSE stream: {e}")
        finally:
            cleanup()

    return StreamingResponse(
        event_generator(),
        media_type="text/event-stream",
        headers={
            "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
            "Connection": "keep-alive",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Cache-Control"
        }
    )
```

**GET /events/{user_id}** - Establishes persistent SSE connection:

- **Parameters** - Takes `user_id` (int) and optional `is_audio` query parameter (defaults to "false")

- **Session Initialization** - Calls `start_agent_session()` and stores the `live_request_queue` in `active_sessions` dict using `user_id` as key

- **StreamingResponse** - Returns `StreamingResponse` with:
  - `event_generator()` async function that wraps `agent_to_client_sse()`
  - MIME type: `text/event-stream` 
  - CORS headers for cross-origin access
  - Cache-control headers to prevent caching

- **Cleanup Logic** - Handles connection termination by closing the request queue and removing from active sessions, with error handling for stream interruptions.

### Session Resumption Configuration

ADK supports live session resumption to improve reliability during streaming conversations. This feature enables automatic reconnection when live connections are interrupted due to network issues.

#### Enabling Session Resumption

To enable session resumption, you need to:

1. **Import the required types**:
```py
from google.genai import types
```

2. **Configure session resumption in RunConfig**:
```py
run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=[modality],
    session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)
```

#### Session Resumption Features

- **Automatic Handle Caching** - The system automatically caches session resumption handles during live conversations
- **Transparent Reconnection** - When connections are interrupted, the system attempts to resume using cached handles
- **Context Preservation** - Conversation context and state are maintained across reconnections
- **Network Resilience** - Provides better user experience during unstable network conditions

#### Implementation Notes

- Session resumption handles are managed internally by the ADK framework
- No additional client-side code changes are required
- The feature is particularly beneficial for long-running streaming conversations
- Connection interruptions become less disruptive to the user experience

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors with session resumption:

1. **Check model compatibility** - Ensure you're using a model that supports session resumption
2. **API limitations** - Some session resumption features may not be available in all API versions
3. **Remove session resumption** - If issues persist, you can disable session resumption by removing the `session_resumption` parameter from `RunConfig`

#### Message Sending Endpoint

```py
@app.post("/send/{user_id}")
async def send_message_endpoint(user_id: int, request: Request):
    """HTTP endpoint for client to agent communication"""

    user_id_str = str(user_id)

    # Get the live request queue for this user
    live_request_queue = active_sessions.get(user_id_str)
    if not live_request_queue:
        return {"error": "Session not found"}

    # Parse the message
    message = await request.json()
    mime_type = message["mime_type"]
    data = message["data"]

    # Send the message to the agent
    if mime_type == "text/plain":
        content = Content(role="user", parts=[Part.from_text(text=data)])
        live_request_queue.send_content(content=content)
        print(f"[CLIENT TO AGENT]: {data}")
    elif mime_type == "audio/pcm":
        decoded_data = base64.b64decode(data)
        live_request_queue.send_realtime(Blob(data=decoded_data, mime_type=mime_type))
        print(f"[CLIENT TO AGENT]: audio/pcm: {len(decoded_data)} bytes")
    else:
        return {"error": f"Mime type not supported: {mime_type}"}

    return {"status": "sent"}
```

**POST /send/{user_id}** - Receives client messages:

- **Session Lookup** - Retrieves `live_request_queue` from `active_sessions` or returns error if session doesn't exist

- **Message Processing** - Parses JSON with `mime_type` and `data` fields:
  - **Text Messages** - Creates `Content` with `Part.from_text()` and sends via `send_content()`
  - **Audio Messages** - Base64 decodes PCM data and sends via `send_realtime()` with `Blob`

- **Error Handling** - Returns appropriate error responses for unsupported MIME types or missing sessions.


## 6. Client side code overview {#6.-client-side-code-overview}

The client-side consists of a web interface with real-time communication and audio capabilities:

### HTML Interface (`static/index.html`)

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>ADK Streaming Test (Audio)</title>
    <script src="/static/js/app.js" type="module"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>ADK Streaming Test</h1>
    <div
      id="messages"
      style="height: 300px; overflow-y: auto; border: 1px solid black"></div>
    <br />

    <form id="messageForm">
      <label for="message">Message:</label>
      <input type="text" id="message" name="message" />
      <button type="submit" id="sendButton" disabled>Send</button>
      <button type="button" id="startAudioButton">Start Audio</button>
    </form>
  </body>

</html>
```

Simple web interface with:
- **Messages Display** - Scrollable div for conversation history
- **Text Input Form** - Input field and send button for text messages
- **Audio Control** - Button to enable audio mode and microphone access

### Main Application Logic (`static/js/app.js`)

#### Session Management (`app.js`)

```js
const sessionId = Math.random().toString().substring(10);
const sse_url =
  "http://" + window.location.host + "/events/" + sessionId;
const send_url =
  "http://" + window.location.host + "/send/" + sessionId;
let is_audio = false;
```

- **Random Session ID** - Generates unique session ID for each browser instance
- **URL Construction** - Builds SSE and send endpoints with session ID
- **Audio Mode Flag** - Tracks whether audio mode is enabled

#### Server-Sent Events Connection (`app.js`)
**connectSSE()** function handles real-time server communication:

```js
// SSE handlers
function connectSSE() {
  // Connect to SSE endpoint
  eventSource = new EventSource(sse_url + "?is_audio=" + is_audio);

  // Handle connection open
  eventSource.onopen = function () {
    // Connection opened messages
    console.log("SSE connection opened.");
    document.getElementById("messages").textContent = "Connection opened";

    // Enable the Send button
    document.getElementById("sendButton").disabled = false;
    addSubmitHandler();
  };

  // Handle incoming messages
  eventSource.onmessage = function (event) {
    ...
  };

  // Handle connection close
  eventSource.onerror = function (event) {
    console.log("SSE connection error or closed.");
    document.getElementById("sendButton").disabled = true;
    document.getElementById("messages").textContent = "Connection closed";
    eventSource.close();
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log("Reconnecting...");
      connectSSE();
    }, 5000);
  };
}
```

- **EventSource Setup** - Creates SSE connection with audio mode parameter
- **Connection Handlers**:
  - **onopen** - Enables send button and form submission when connected
  - **onmessage** - Processes incoming messages from agent
  - **onerror** - Handles disconnections with auto-reconnect after 5 seconds

#### Message Processing (`app.js`)
Handles different message types from server:

```js
  // Handle incoming messages
  eventSource.onmessage = function (event) {
    // Parse the incoming message
    const message_from_server = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log("[AGENT TO CLIENT] ", message_from_server);

    // Check if the turn is complete
    // if turn complete, add new message
    if (
      message_from_server.turn_complete &&
      message_from_server.turn_complete == true
    ) {
      currentMessageId = null;
      return;
    }

    // If it's audio, play it
    if (message_from_server.mime_type == "audio/pcm" && audioPlayerNode) {
      audioPlayerNode.port.postMessage(base64ToArray(message_from_server.data));
    }

    // If it's a text, print it
    if (message_from_server.mime_type == "text/plain") {
      // add a new message for a new turn
      if (currentMessageId == null) {
        currentMessageId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
        const message = document.createElement("p");
        message.id = currentMessageId;
        // Append the message element to the messagesDiv
        messagesDiv.appendChild(message);
      }

      // Add message text to the existing message element
      const message = document.getElementById(currentMessageId);
      message.textContent += message_from_server.data;

      // Scroll down to the bottom of the messagesDiv
      messagesDiv.scrollTop = messagesDiv.scrollHeight;
    }
```

- **Turn Management** - Detects `turn_complete` to reset message state
- **Audio Playback** - Decodes Base64 PCM data and sends to audio worklet
- **Text Display** - Creates new message elements and appends partial text updates for real-time typing effect

#### Message Sending (`app.js`)
**sendMessage()** function sends data to server:

```js
async function sendMessage(message) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(send_url, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(message)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      console.error('Failed to send message:', response.statusText);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending message:', error);
  }
}
```

- **HTTP POST** - Sends JSON payload to `/send/{session_id}` endpoint
- **Error Handling** - Logs failed requests and network errors
- **Message Format** - Standardized `{mime_type, data}` structure

### Audio Player (`static/js/audio-player.js`)

**startAudioPlayerWorklet()** function:

- **AudioContext Setup** - Creates context with 24kHz sample rate for playback
- **Worklet Loading** - Loads PCM player processor for audio handling
- **Audio Pipeline** - Connects worklet node to audio destination (speakers)

### Audio Recorder (`static/js/audio-recorder.js`)

**startAudioRecorderWorklet()** function:

- **AudioContext Setup** - Creates context with 16kHz sample rate for recording
- **Microphone Access** - Requests user media permissions for audio input
- **Audio Processing** - Connects microphone to recorder worklet
- **Data Conversion** - Converts Float32 samples to 16-bit PCM format

### Audio Worklet Processors

#### PCM Player Processor (`static/js/pcm-player-processor.js`)
**PCMPlayerProcessor** class handles audio playback:

- **Ring Buffer** - Circular buffer for 180 seconds of 24kHz audio
- **Data Ingestion** - Converts Int16 to Float32 and stores in buffer
- **Playback Loop** - Continuously reads from buffer to output channels
- **Overflow Handling** - Overwrites oldest samples when buffer is full

#### PCM Recorder Processor (`static/js/pcm-recorder-processor.js`)
**PCMProcessor** class captures microphone input:

- **Audio Input** - Processes incoming audio frames
- **Data Transfer** - Copies Float32 samples and posts to main thread via message port

#### Mode Switching:
- **Audio Activation** - "Start Audio" button enables microphone and reconnects SSE with audio flag
- **Seamless Transition** - Closes existing connection and establishes new audio-enabled session

The client architecture enables seamless real-time communication with both text and audio modalities, using modern web APIs for professional-grade audio processing.

## Summary

This application demonstrates a complete real-time AI agent system with the following key features:

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **Real-time**: Streaming responses with partial text updates and continuous audio

# Bidi-streaming(live) in ADK

!!! warning

    This is an experimental feature. Currrently available in Python.

!!! info

    This is different from server-side streaming or token-level streaming. 
    Token-level streaming is a one-way process where a language model generates a response and sends it back to the user one token at a time. This creates a "typing" effect, giving the impression of an immediate response and reducing the time it takes to see the start of the answer. The user sends their full prompt, the model processes it, and then the model begins to generate and send back the response piece by piece. This section is for bidi-streaming (live).
    
Bidi-streaming (live) in ADK adds the low-latency bidirectional voice and video interaction
capability of [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) to
AI agents.

With bidi-streaming (live) mode, you can provide end users with the experience of natural,
human-like voice conversations, including the ability for the user to interrupt
the agent's responses with voice commands. Agents with streaming can process
text, audio, and video inputs, and they can provide text and audio output.

-   :material-console-line: **Quickstart (Bidi-streaming)**

    ---

# Streaming Tools

!!! info

    This is only supported in streaming(live) agents/api.

Streaming tools allows tools(functions) to stream intermediate results back to agents and agents can respond to those intermediate results. 
For example, we can use streaming tools to monitor the changes of the stock price and have the agent react to it. Another example is we can have the agent monitor the video stream, and when there is changes in video stream, the agent can report the changes.

To define a streaming tool, you must adhere to the following:

1.  **Asynchronous Function:** The tool must be an `async` Python function.
2.  **AsyncGenerator Return Type:** The function must be typed to return an `AsyncGenerator`. The first type parameter to `AsyncGenerator` is the type of the data you `yield` (e.g., `str` for text messages, or a custom object for structured data). The second type parameter is typically `None` if the generator doesn't receive values via `send()`.


We support two types of streaming tools:
- Simple type. This is a one type of streaming tools that only take non video/audio streams(the streams that you feed to adk web or adk runner) as input.
- Video streaming tools. This only works in video streaming and the video stream(the streams that you feed to adk web or adk runner) will be passed into this function.

Now let's define an agent that can monitor stock price changes and monitor the video stream changes. 

```python
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncGenerator

from google.adk.agents import LiveRequestQueue
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.tools.function_tool import FunctionTool
from google.genai import Client
from google.genai import types as genai_types


async def monitor_stock_price(stock_symbol: str) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
  """This function will monitor the price for the given stock_symbol in a continuous, streaming and asynchronously way."""
  print(f"Start monitor stock price for {stock_symbol}!")

  # Let's mock stock price change.
  await asyncio.sleep(4)
  price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 300"
  yield price_alert1
  print(price_alert1)

  await asyncio.sleep(4)
  price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 400"
  yield price_alert1
  print(price_alert1)

  await asyncio.sleep(20)
  price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 900"
  yield price_alert1
  print(price_alert1)

  await asyncio.sleep(20)
  price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 500"
  yield price_alert1
  print(price_alert1)


# for video streaming, `input_stream: LiveRequestQueue` is required and reserved key parameter for ADK to pass the video streams in.
async def monitor_video_stream(
    input_stream: LiveRequestQueue,
) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
  """Monitor how many people are in the video streams."""
  print("start monitor_video_stream!")
  client = Client(vertexai=False)
  prompt_text = (
      "Count the number of people in this image. Just respond with a numeric"
      " number."
  )
  last_count = None
  while True:
    last_valid_req = None
    print("Start monitoring loop")

    # use this loop to pull the latest images and discard the old ones
    while input_stream._queue.qsize() != 0:
      live_req = await input_stream.get()

      if live_req.blob is not None and live_req.blob.mime_type == "image/jpeg":
        last_valid_req = live_req

    # If we found a valid image, process it
    if last_valid_req is not None:
      print("Processing the most recent frame from the queue")

      # Create an image part using the blob's data and mime type
      image_part = genai_types.Part.from_bytes(
          data=last_valid_req.blob.data, mime_type=last_valid_req.blob.mime_type
      )

      contents = genai_types.Content(
          role="user",
          parts=[image_part, genai_types.Part.from_text(prompt_text)],
      )

      # Call the model to generate content based on the provided image and prompt
      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
          contents=contents,
          config=genai_types.GenerateContentConfig(
              system_instruction=(
                  "You are a helpful video analysis assistant. You can count"
                  " the number of people in this image or video. Just respond"
                  " with a numeric number."
              )
          ),
      )
      if not last_count:
        last_count = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text
      elif last_count != response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text:
        last_count = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text
        yield response
        print("response:", response)

    # Wait before checking for new images
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)


# Use this exact function to help ADK stop your streaming tools when requested.
# for example, if we want to stop `monitor_stock_price`, then the agent will
# invoke this function with stop_streaming(function_name=monitor_stock_price).
def stop_streaming(function_name: str):
  """Stop the streaming

  Args:
    function_name: The name of the streaming function to stop.
  """
  pass


root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    name="video_streaming_agent",
    instruction="""

# Code Execution Tool with Agent Engine

The Agent Engine Code Execution ADK Tool provides a low-latency, highly
efficient method for running AI-generated code using the
[Google Cloud Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview)
service. This tool is designed for fast execution, tailored for agentic workflows,
and uses sandboxed environments for improved security. The Code Execution tool 
allows code and data to persist over multiple requests, enabling complex, 
multi-step coding tasks, including:

-   **Code development and debugging:** Create agent tasks that test and
    iterate on versions of code over multiple requests.
-   **Code with data analysis:** Upload data files up to 100MB, and run
    multiple code-based analyses without the need to reload data for each code run.

This code execution tool is part of the Agent Engine suite, however you do not
have to deploy your agent to Agent Engine to use it. You can run your agent
locally or with other services and use this tool. For more information about the
Code Execution feature in Agent Engine, see the
[Agent Engine Code Execution](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/code-execution/overview)
documentation.

!!! example "Preview release"
    The Agent Engine Code Execution feature is a Preview release. For
    more information, see the
    [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).

## Use the Tool

Using the Agent Engine Code Execution tool requires that you create a sandbox
environment with Google Cloud Agent Engine before using the tool with an ADK
agent.

To use the Code Execution tool with your ADK agent:

1.  Follow the instructions in the Agent Engine
    [Code Execution quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/code-execution/quickstart)
    to create a code execution sandbox environment.
1.  Create an ADK agent with settings to access the Google Cloud project
    where you created the sandbox environment.
1.  The following code example shows an agent configured to use the Code
    Executor tool. Replace `SANDBOX_RESOURCE_NAME` with the sandbox environment 
    resource name you created.

```python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.code_executors.agent_engine_sandbox_code_executor import AgentEngineSandboxCodeExecutor

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    name="agent_engine_code_execution_agent",
    instruction="You are a helpful agent that can write and execute code to answer questions and solve problems.",
    code_executor=AgentEngineSandboxCodeExecutor(
        sandbox_resource_name="SANDBOX_RESOURCE_NAME",
    ),
)
```

For details on the expected format of the `sandbox_resource_name` value, and the
alternative `agent_engine_resource_name` parameter, see [Configuration
parameters](#config-parameters). For a more advanced example, including
recommended system instructions for the tool, see the [Advanced
example](#advanced-example) or the full 
[agent code example](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/agent_engine_code_execution).

## How it works

The `AgentEngineCodeExecutor` Tool maintains a single sandbox throughout an
agent's task, meaning the sandbox's state persists across all operations within
an ADK workflow session.

1.  **Sandbox creation:** For multi-step tasks requiring code execution,
    the Agent Engine creates a sandbox with specified language and machine
    configurations, isolating the code execution environment. If no sandbox is
    pre-created, the code execution tool will automatically create one using
    default settings.
1.  **Code execution with persistence:** AI-generated code for a tool call
    is streamed to the sandbox and then executed within the isolated
    environment. After execution, the sandbox *remains active* for subsequent
    tool calls within the same session, preserving variables, imported modules,
    and file state for the next tool call from the same agent.
1.  **Result retrieval:** The standard output, and any captured error
    streams are collected and passed back to the calling agent.
1.  **Sandbox clean up:** Once the agent task or conversation concludes, the
    agent can explicitly delete the sandbox, or rely on the TTL feature of the
    sandbox specified when creating the sandbox.

## Key benefits

-   **Persistent state:** Solve complex tasks where data manipulation or
    variable context must carry over between multiple tool calls.
-   **Targeted Isolation:** Provides robust process-level isolation,
    ensuring that tool code execution is safe while remaining lightweight.
-   **Agent Engine integration:** Tightly integrated into the Agent Engine
    tool-use and orchestration layer.
-   **Low-latency performance:** Designed for speed, allowing agents to
    execute complex tool-use workflows efficiently without significant overhead.
-   **Flexible compute configurations:** Create sandboxes with specific
    programming language, processing power, and memory configurations.

## System requirements¶

The following requirements must be met to successfully use the Agent Engine
Code Execution tool with your ADK agents:

-   Google Cloud project with Vertex API enabled
-   Agent's service account requires **roles/aiplatform.user** role, which
    allow it to:
    -   Create, get, list and delete code execution sandboxes
    -   Execute code execution sandbox

## Configuration parameters {#config-parameters}

The Agent Engine Code Execution tool has the following parameters. You must set
one of the following resource parameters:

-   **`sandbox_resource_name`** : A sandbox resource path to an
    existing sandbox environment it uses for each tool call. The expected
string format is as follows:
    ```
    projects/{$PROJECT_ID}/locations/{$LOCATION_ID}/reasoningEngines/{$REASONING_ENGINE_ID}/sandboxEnvironments/{$SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT_ID}
    
    # Example:
    projects/my-vertex-agent-project/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/6842888880301111172/sandboxEnvironments/6545148888889161728
    ```
-   **`agent_engine_resource_name`**: Agent Engine resource name where the tool
creates a sandbox environment. The expected string format is as follows:
    ```
    projects/{$PROJECT_ID}/locations/{$LOCATION_ID}/reasoningEngines/{$REASONING_ENGINE_ID}
    
    # Example:
    projects/my-vertex-agent-project/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/6842888880301111172
    ```

You can use Google Cloud Agent Engine's API to configure Agent Engine sandbox
environments separately using a Google Cloud client connection, including the
following settings:

-   **Programming languages,** including Python and JavaScript
-   **Compute environment**, including CPU and memory sizes

For more information on connecting to Google Cloud Agent Engine and configuring
sandbox environments, see the Agent Engine
[Code Execution quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/code-execution/quickstart#create_a_sandbox).

## Advanced example {#advanced-example}

The following example code shows how to implement use of the Code Executor tool
in an ADK agent. This example includes a `base_system_instruction` clause to set
the operating guidelines for code execution. This instruction clause is
optional, but strongly recommended for getting the best results from this tool.

```python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.code_executors.agent_engine_sandbox_code_executor import AgentEngineSandboxCodeExecutor

def base_system_instruction():
  """Returns: data science agent system instruction."""

  return """
  # Guidelines

  **Objective:** Assist the user in achieving their data analysis goals, **with emphasis on avoiding assumptions and ensuring accuracy.** Reaching that goal can involve multiple steps. When you need to generate code, you **don't** need to solve the goal in one go. Only generate the next step at a time.

  **Code Execution:** All code snippets provided will be executed within the sandbox environment.

  **Statefulness:** All code snippets are executed and the variables stays in the environment. You NEVER need to re-initialize variables. You NEVER need to reload files. You NEVER need to re-import libraries.

  **Output Visibility:** Always print the output of code execution to visualize results, especially for data exploration and analysis. For example:
    - To look a the shape of a pandas.DataFrame do:
      ```tool_code
      print(df.shape)
      ```
      The output will be presented to you as:
      ```tool_outputs
      (49, 7)

      ```
    - To display the result of a numerical computation:
      ```tool_code
      x = 10 ** 9 - 12 ** 5
      print(f'{{x=}}')
      ```
      The output will be presented to you as:
      ```tool_outputs
      x=999751168

      ```
    - You **never** generate ```tool_outputs yourself.
    - You can then use this output to decide on next steps.
    - Print just variables (e.g., `print(f'{{variable=}}')`.

  **No Assumptions:** **Crucially, avoid making assumptions about the nature of the data or column names.** Base findings solely on the data itself. Always use the information obtained from `explore_df` to guide your analysis.

  **Available files:** Only use the files that are available as specified in the list of available files.

  **Data in prompt:** Some queries contain the input data directly in the prompt. You have to parse that data into a pandas DataFrame. ALWAYS parse all the data. NEVER edit the data that are given to you.

  **Answerability:** Some queries may not be answerable with the available data. In those cases, inform the user why you cannot process their query and suggest what type of data would be needed to fulfill their request.

  """

root_agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    name="agent_engine_code_execution_agent",
    instruction=base_system_instruction() + """


You need to assist the user with their queries by looking at the data and the context in the conversation.
You final answer should summarize the code and code execution relevant to the user query.

You should include all pieces of data to answer the user query, such as the table from code execution results.
If you cannot answer the question directly, you should follow the guidelines above to generate the next step.
If the question can be answered directly with writing any code, you should do that.
If you doesn't have enough data to answer the question, you should ask for clarification from the user.

You should NEVER install any package on your own like `pip install ...`.
When plotting trends, you should make sure to sort and order the data by the x-axis.

# Third Party Tools

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

ADK is designed to be **highly extensible, allowing you to seamlessly integrate tools from other AI Agent frameworks** like CrewAI and LangChain. This interoperability is crucial because it allows for faster development time and allows you to reuse existing tools.

## Using LangChain Tools

ADK provides the `LangchainTool` wrapper to integrate tools from the LangChain ecosystem into your agents.

### Example: Web Search using LangChain's Tavily tool

[Tavily](https://tavily.com/) provides a search API that returns answers derived from real-time search results, intended for use by applications like AI agents.

1. Follow [ADK installation and setup](/adk-docs/get-started/installation.md) guide.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary LangChain packages installed. For example, to use the Tavily search tool, install its specific dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install langchain_community tavily-python
    ```

3. Obtain a [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) API KEY and export it as an environment variable.

    ```bash
    export TAVILY_API_KEY=<REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY>
    ```

4. **Import:** Import the `LangchainTool` wrapper from ADK and the specific `LangChain` tool you wish to use (e.g, `TavilySearchResults`).

    ```py
    from google.adk.tools.langchain_tool import LangchainTool
    from langchain_community.tools import TavilySearchResults
    ```

5. **Instantiate & Wrap:** Create an instance of your LangChain tool and pass it to the `LangchainTool` constructor.

    ```py
    # Instantiate the LangChain tool
    tavily_tool_instance = TavilySearchResults(
        max_results=5,
        search_depth="advanced",
        include_answer=True,
        include_raw_content=True,
        include_images=True,
    )

    # Wrap it with LangchainTool for ADK
    adk_tavily_tool = LangchainTool(tool=tavily_tool_instance)
    ```

6. **Add to Agent:** Include the wrapped `LangchainTool` instance in your agent's `tools` list during definition.

    ```py
    from google.adk import Agent

    # Define the ADK agent, including the wrapped tool
    my_agent = Agent(
        name="langchain_tool_agent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="Agent to answer questions using TavilySearch.",
        instruction="I can answer your questions by searching the internet. Just ask me anything!",
        tools=[adk_tavily_tool] # Add the wrapped tool here
    )
    ```

### Full Example: Tavily Search

Here's the full code combining the steps above to create and run an agent using the LangChain Tavily search tool.

```py
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/third-party/langchain_tavily_search.py"
```

## Using CrewAI tools

ADK provides the `CrewaiTool` wrapper to integrate tools from the CrewAI library.

### Example: Web Search using CrewAI's Serper API

[Serper API](https://serper.dev/) provides access to Google Search results programmatically. It allows applications, like AI agents, to perform real-time Google searches (including news, images, etc.) and get structured data back without needing to scrape web pages directly.

1. Follow [ADK installation and setup](/adk-docs/get-started/installation.md) guide.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary CrewAI tools package. For example, to use the SerperDevTool:

    ```bash
    pip install crewai-tools
    ```

3. Obtain a [Serper API KEY](https://serper.dev/) and export it as an environment variable.

    ```bash
    export SERPER_API_KEY=<REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY>
    ```

4. **Import:** Import `CrewaiTool` from ADK and the desired CrewAI tool (e.g, `SerperDevTool`).

    ```py
    from google.adk.tools.crewai_tool import CrewaiTool
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
    ```

5. **Instantiate & Wrap:** Create an instance of the CrewAI tool. Pass it to the `CrewaiTool` constructor. **Crucially, you must provide a name and description** to the ADK wrapper, as these are used by ADK's underlying model to understand when to use the tool.

    ```py
    # Instantiate the CrewAI tool
    serper_tool_instance = SerperDevTool(
        n_results=10,
        save_file=False,
        search_type="news",
    )

    # Wrap it with CrewaiTool for ADK, providing name and description
    adk_serper_tool = CrewaiTool(
        name="InternetNewsSearch",
        description="Searches the internet specifically for recent news articles using Serper.",
        tool=serper_tool_instance
    )
    ```

6. **Add to Agent:** Include the wrapped `CrewaiTool` instance in your agent's `tools` list.

    ```py
    from google.adk import Agent

    # Define the ADK agent
    my_agent = Agent(
        name="crewai_search_agent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="Agent to find recent news using the Serper search tool.",
        instruction="I can find the latest news for you. What topic are you interested in?",
        tools=[adk_serper_tool] # Add the wrapped tool here
    )
    ```

### Full Example: Serper API

Here's the full code combining the steps above to create and run an agent using the CrewAI Serper API search tool.

# OpenAPI Integration

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

## Integrating REST APIs with OpenAPI

ADK simplifies interacting with external REST APIs by automatically generating callable tools directly from an [OpenAPI Specification (v3.x)](https://swagger.io/specification/). This eliminates the need to manually define individual function tools for each API endpoint.

!!! tip "Core Benefit"
    Use `OpenAPIToolset` to instantly create agent tools (`RestApiTool`) from your existing API documentation (OpenAPI spec), enabling agents to seamlessly call your web services.

## Key Components

* **`OpenAPIToolset`**: This is the primary class you'll use. You initialize it with your OpenAPI specification, and it handles the parsing and generation of tools.
* **`RestApiTool`**: This class represents a single, callable API operation (like `GET /pets/{petId}` or `POST /pets`). `OpenAPIToolset` creates one `RestApiTool` instance for each operation defined in your spec.

## How it Works

The process involves these main steps when you use `OpenAPIToolset`:

1. **Initialization & Parsing**:
    * You provide the OpenAPI specification to `OpenAPIToolset` either as a Python dictionary, a JSON string, or a YAML string.
    * The toolset internally parses the spec, resolving any internal references (`$ref`) to understand the complete API structure.

2. **Operation Discovery**:
    * It identifies all valid API operations (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) defined within the `paths` object of your specification.

3. **Tool Generation**:
    * For each discovered operation, `OpenAPIToolset` automatically creates a corresponding `RestApiTool` instance.
    * **Tool Name**: Derived from the `operationId` in the spec (converted to `snake_case`, max 60 chars). If `operationId` is missing, a name is generated from the method and path.
    * **Tool Description**: Uses the `summary` or `description` from the operation for the LLM.
    * **API Details**: Stores the required HTTP method, path, server base URL, parameters (path, query, header, cookie), and request body schema internally.

4. **`RestApiTool` Functionality**: Each generated `RestApiTool`:
    * **Schema Generation**: Dynamically creates a `FunctionDeclaration` based on the operation's parameters and request body. This schema tells the LLM how to call the tool (what arguments are expected).
    * **Execution**: When called by the LLM, it constructs the correct HTTP request (URL, headers, query params, body) using the arguments provided by the LLM and the details from the OpenAPI spec. It handles authentication (if configured) and executes the API call using the `requests` library.
    * **Response Handling**: Returns the API response (typically JSON) back to the agent flow.

5. **Authentication**: You can configure global authentication (like API keys or OAuth - see [Authentication](/adk-docs/tools/authentication.md) for details) when initializing `OpenAPIToolset`. This authentication configuration is automatically applied to all generated `RestApiTool` instances.

## Usage Workflow

Follow these steps to integrate an OpenAPI spec into your agent:

1. **Obtain Spec**: Get your OpenAPI specification document (e.g., load from a `.json` or `.yaml` file, fetch from a URL).
2. **Instantiate Toolset**: Create an `OpenAPIToolset` instance, passing the spec content and type (`spec_str`/`spec_dict`, `spec_str_type`). Provide authentication details (`auth_scheme`, `auth_credential`) if required by the API.

    ```python
    from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.openapi_spec_parser.openapi_toolset import OpenAPIToolset

    # Example with a JSON string
    openapi_spec_json = '...' # Your OpenAPI JSON string
    toolset = OpenAPIToolset(spec_str=openapi_spec_json, spec_str_type="json")

    # Example with a dictionary
    # openapi_spec_dict = {...} # Your OpenAPI spec as a dict
    # toolset = OpenAPIToolset(spec_dict=openapi_spec_dict)
    ```

3. **Add to Agent**: Include the retrieved tools in your `LlmAgent`'s `tools` list.

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

    my_agent = LlmAgent(
        name="api_interacting_agent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred model
        tools=[toolset], # Pass the toolset
        # ... other agent config ...
    )
    ```

4. **Instruct Agent**: Update your agent's instructions to inform it about the new API capabilities and the names of the tools it can use (e.g., `list_pets`, `create_pet`). The tool descriptions generated from the spec will also help the LLM.
5. **Run Agent**: Execute your agent using the `Runner`. When the LLM determines it needs to call one of the APIs, it will generate a function call targeting the appropriate `RestApiTool`, which will then handle the HTTP request automatically.

## Example

This example demonstrates generating tools from a simple Pet Store OpenAPI spec (using `httpbin.org` for mock responses) and interacting with them via an agent.

# Authenticating with Tools

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

## Core Concepts

Many tools need to access protected resources (like user data in Google Calendar, Salesforce records, etc.) and require authentication. ADK provides a system to handle various authentication methods securely.

The key components involved are:

1. **`AuthScheme`**: Defines *how* an API expects authentication credentials (e.g., as an API Key in a header, an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token). ADK supports the same types of authentication schemes as OpenAPI 3.0. To know more about what each type of credential is, refer to [OpenAPI doc: Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/). ADK uses specific classes like `APIKey`, `HTTPBearer`, `OAuth2`, `OpenIdConnectWithConfig`.  
2. **`AuthCredential`**: Holds the *initial* information needed to *start* the authentication process (e.g., your application's OAuth Client ID/Secret, an API key value). It includes an `auth_type` (like `API_KEY`, `OAUTH2`, `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`) specifying the credential type.

The general flow involves providing these details when configuring a tool. ADK then attempts to automatically exchange the initial credential for a usable one (like an access token) before the tool makes an API call. For flows requiring user interaction (like OAuth consent), a specific interactive process involving the Agent Client application is triggered.

## Supported Initial Credential Types

* **API\_KEY:** For simple key/value authentication. Usually requires no exchange.  
* **HTTP:** Can represent Basic Auth (not recommended/supported for exchange) or already obtained Bearer tokens. If it's a Bearer token, no exchange is needed.  
* **OAUTH2:** For standard OAuth 2.0 flows. Requires configuration (client ID, secret, scopes) and often triggers the interactive flow for user consent.  
* **OPEN\_ID\_CONNECT:** For authentication based on OpenID Connect. Similar to OAuth2, often requires configuration and user interaction.  
* **SERVICE\_ACCOUNT:** For Google Cloud Service Account credentials (JSON key or Application Default Credentials). Typically exchanged for a Bearer token.

## Configuring Authentication on Tools

You set up authentication when defining your tool:

* **RestApiTool / OpenAPIToolset**: Pass `auth_scheme` and `auth_credential` during initialization

* **GoogleApiToolSet Tools**: ADK has built-in 1st party tools like Google Calendar, BigQuery etc,. Use the toolset's specific method.

* **APIHubToolset / ApplicationIntegrationToolset**: Pass `auth_scheme` and `auth_credential`during initialization, if the API managed in API Hub / provided by Application Integration requires authentication.

!!! tip "WARNING" 
    Storing sensitive credentials like access tokens and especially refresh tokens directly in the session state might pose security risks depending on your session storage backend (`SessionService`) and overall application security posture.

    *   **`InMemorySessionService`:** Suitable for testing and development, but data is lost when the process ends. Less risk as it's transient.
    *   **Database/Persistent Storage:** **Strongly consider encrypting** the token data before storing it in the database using a robust encryption library (like `cryptography`) and managing encryption keys securely (e.g., using a key management service).
    *   **Secure Secret Stores:** For production environments, storing sensitive credentials in a dedicated secret manager (like Google Cloud Secret Manager or HashiCorp Vault) is the **most recommended approach**. Your tool could potentially store only short-lived access tokens or secure references (not the refresh token itself) in the session state, fetching the necessary secrets from the secure store when needed.

## Journey 1: Building Agentic Applications with Authenticated Tools

This section focuses on using pre-existing tools (like those from `RestApiTool/ OpenAPIToolset`, `APIHubToolset`, `GoogleApiToolSet`) that require authentication within your agentic application. Your main responsibility is configuring the tools and handling the client-side part of interactive authentication flows (if required by the tool).

### 1. Configuring Tools with Authentication

When adding an authenticated tool to your agent, you need to provide its required `AuthScheme` and your application's initial `AuthCredential`.

**A. Using OpenAPI-based Toolsets (`OpenAPIToolset`, `APIHubToolset`, etc.)**

Pass the scheme and credential during toolset initialization. The toolset applies them to all generated tools. Here are few ways to create tools with authentication in ADK.

=== "API Key"

      Create a tool requiring an API Key.

      ```py
      from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.auth.auth_helpers import token_to_scheme_credential
      from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.openapi_spec_parser.openapi_toolset import OpenAPIToolset

      auth_scheme, auth_credential = token_to_scheme_credential(
          "apikey", "query", "apikey", "YOUR_API_KEY_STRING"
      )
      sample_api_toolset = OpenAPIToolset(
          spec_str="...",  # Fill this with an OpenAPI spec string
          spec_str_type="yaml",
          auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
          auth_credential=auth_credential,
      )
      ```

=== "OAuth2"

      Create a tool requiring OAuth2.

      ```py
      from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.openapi_spec_parser.openapi_toolset import OpenAPIToolset
      from fastapi.openapi.models import OAuth2
      from fastapi.openapi.models import OAuthFlowAuthorizationCode
      from fastapi.openapi.models import OAuthFlows
      from google.adk.auth import AuthCredential
      from google.adk.auth import AuthCredentialTypes
      from google.adk.auth import OAuth2Auth

      auth_scheme = OAuth2(
          flows=OAuthFlows(
              authorizationCode=OAuthFlowAuthorizationCode(
                  authorizationUrl="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
                  tokenUrl="https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
                  scopes={
                      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar": "calendar scope"
                  },
              )
          )
      )
      auth_credential = AuthCredential(
          auth_type=AuthCredentialTypes.OAUTH2,
          oauth2=OAuth2Auth(
              client_id=YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID, 
              client_secret=YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
          ),
      )

      calendar_api_toolset = OpenAPIToolset(
          spec_str=google_calendar_openapi_spec_str, # Fill this with an openapi spec
          spec_str_type='yaml',
          auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
          auth_credential=auth_credential,
      )
      ```

=== "Service Account"

      Create a tool requiring Service Account.

      ```py
      from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.auth.auth_helpers import service_account_dict_to_scheme_credential
      from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.openapi_spec_parser.openapi_toolset import OpenAPIToolset

      service_account_cred = json.loads(service_account_json_str)
      auth_scheme, auth_credential = service_account_dict_to_scheme_credential(
          config=service_account_cred,
          scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"],
      )
      sample_toolset = OpenAPIToolset(
          spec_str=sa_openapi_spec_str, # Fill this with an openapi spec
          spec_str_type='json',
          auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
          auth_credential=auth_credential,
      )
      ```

=== "OpenID connect"

      Create a tool requiring OpenID connect.

      ```py
      from google.adk.auth.auth_schemes import OpenIdConnectWithConfig
      from google.adk.auth.auth_credential import AuthCredential, AuthCredentialTypes, OAuth2Auth
      from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.openapi_spec_parser.openapi_toolset import OpenAPIToolset

      auth_scheme = OpenIdConnectWithConfig(
          authorization_endpoint=OAUTH2_AUTH_ENDPOINT_URL,
          token_endpoint=OAUTH2_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_URL,
          scopes=['openid', 'YOUR_OAUTH_SCOPES"]
      )
      auth_credential = AuthCredential(
          auth_type=AuthCredentialTypes.OPEN_ID_CONNECT,
          oauth2=OAuth2Auth(
              client_id="...",
              client_secret="...",
          )
      )

      userinfo_toolset = OpenAPIToolset(
          spec_str=content, # Fill in an actual spec
          spec_str_type='yaml',
          auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
          auth_credential=auth_credential,
      )
      ```

**B. Using Google API Toolsets (e.g., `calendar_tool_set`)**

These toolsets often have dedicated configuration methods.

Tip: For how to create a Google OAuth Client ID & Secret, see this guide: [Get your Google API Client ID](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid#get_your_google_api_client_id)

```py
# Example: Configuring Google Calendar Tools
from google.adk.tools.google_api_tool import calendar_tool_set

client_id = "YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret = "YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"

# Use the specific configure method for this toolset type
calendar_tool_set.configure_auth(
    client_id=oauth_client_id, client_secret=oauth_client_secret
)

# agent = LlmAgent(..., tools=calendar_tool_set.get_tool('calendar_tool_set'))
```

The sequence diagram of auth request flow (where tools are requesting auth credentials) looks like below:

![Authentication](../assets/auth_part1.svg) 


### 2. Handling the Interactive OAuth/OIDC Flow (Client-Side)

If a tool requires user login/consent (typically OAuth 2.0 or OIDC), the ADK framework pauses execution and signals your **Agent Client** application. There are two cases:

* **Agent Client** application runs the agent directly (via `runner.run_async`) in the same process. e.g. UI backend, CLI app, or Spark job etc.
* **Agent Client** application interacts with ADK's fastapi server via `/run` or `/run_sse` endpoint. While ADK's fastapi server could be setup on the same server or different server as **Agent Client** application

The second case is a special case of first case, because `/run` or `/run_sse` endpoint also invokes `runner.run_async`. The only differences are:

* Whether to call a python function to run the agent (first case) or call a service endpoint to run the agent (second case).
* Whether the result events are in-memory objects (first case) or serialized json string in http response (second case).

Below sections focus on the first case and you should be able to map it to the second case very straightforward. We will also describe some differences to handle for the second case if necessary.

Here's the step-by-step process for your client application:

**Step 1: Run Agent & Detect Auth Request**

* Initiate the agent interaction using `runner.run_async`.  
* Iterate through the yielded events.  
* Look for a specific function call event whose function call has a special name: `adk_request_credential`. This event signals that user interaction is needed. You can use helper functions to identify this event and extract necessary information. (For the second case, the logic is similar. You deserialize the event from the http response).

```py

# runner = Runner(...)
# session = await session_service.create_session(...)
# content = types.Content(...) # User's initial query

print("\nRunning agent...")
events_async = runner.run_async(
    session_id=session.id, user_id='user', new_message=content
)

auth_request_function_call_id, auth_config = None, None

async for event in events_async:
    # Use helper to check for the specific auth request event
    if (auth_request_function_call := get_auth_request_function_call(event)):
        print("--> Authentication required by agent.")
        # Store the ID needed to respond later
        if not (auth_request_function_call_id := auth_request_function_call.id):
            raise ValueError(f'Cannot get function call id from function call: {auth_request_function_call}')
        # Get the AuthConfig containing the auth_uri etc.
        auth_config = get_auth_config(auth_request_function_call)
        break # Stop processing events for now, need user interaction

if not auth_request_function_call_id:
    print("\nAuth not required or agent finished.")
    # return # Or handle final response if received

```

*Helper functions `helpers.py`:*

```py
from google.adk.events import Event
from google.adk.auth import AuthConfig # Import necessary type
from google.genai import types

def get_auth_request_function_call(event: Event) -> types.FunctionCall:
    # Get the special auth request function call from the event
    if not event.content or not event.content.parts:
        return
    for part in event.content.parts:
        if (
            part 
            and part.function_call 
            and part.function_call.name == 'adk_request_credential'
            and event.long_running_tool_ids 
            and part.function_call.id in event.long_running_tool_ids
        ):

            return part.function_call

def get_auth_config(auth_request_function_call: types.FunctionCall) -> AuthConfig:
    # Extracts the AuthConfig object from the arguments of the auth request function call
    if not auth_request_function_call.args or not (auth_config := auth_request_function_call.args.get('authConfig')):
        raise ValueError(f'Cannot get auth config from function call: {auth_request_function_call}')
    if isinstance(auth_config, dict):
        auth_config = AuthConfig.model_validate(auth_config)
    elif not isinstance(auth_config, AuthConfig):
        raise ValueError(f'Cannot get auth config {auth_config} is not an instance of AuthConfig.')
    return auth_config
```

**Step 2: Redirect User for Authorization**

* Get the authorization URL (`auth_uri`) from the `auth_config` extracted in the previous step.  
* **Crucially, append your application's**  redirect\_uri as a query parameter to this `auth_uri`. This `redirect_uri` must be pre-registered with your OAuth provider (e.g., [Google Cloud Console](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred), [Okta admin panel](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app-redirect/spring-boot/main/#create-an-app-integration-in-the-admin-console)).  
* Direct the user to this complete URL (e.g., open it in their browser).

```py
# (Continuing after detecting auth needed)

if auth_request_function_call_id and auth_config:
    # Get the base authorization URL from the AuthConfig
    base_auth_uri = auth_config.exchanged_auth_credential.oauth2.auth_uri

    if base_auth_uri:
        redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:8000/callback' # MUST match your OAuth client app config
        # Append redirect_uri (use urlencode in production)
        auth_request_uri = base_auth_uri + f'&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}'
        # Now you need to redirect your end user to this auth_request_uri or ask them to open this auth_request_uri in their browser
        # This auth_request_uri should be served by the corresponding auth provider and the end user should login and authorize your applicaiton to access their data
        # And then the auth provider will redirect the end user to the redirect_uri you provided
        # Next step: Get this callback URL from the user (or your web server handler)
    else:
         print("ERROR: Auth URI not found in auth_config.")
         # Handle error

```

**Step 3. Handle the Redirect Callback (Client):**

* Your application must have a mechanism (e.g., a web server route at the `redirect_uri`) to receive the user after they authorize the application with the provider.  
* The provider redirects the user to your `redirect_uri` and appends an `authorization_code` (and potentially `state`, `scope`) as query parameters to the URL.  
* Capture the **full callback URL** from this incoming request.  
* (This step happens outside the main agent execution loop, in your web server or equivalent callback handler.)

**Step 4. Send Authentication Result Back to ADK (Client):**

* Once you have the full callback URL (containing the authorization code), retrieve the `auth_request_function_call_id` and the `auth_config` object saved in Client Step 1\.  
* Set the captured callback URL into the `exchanged_auth_credential.oauth2.auth_response_uri` field. Also ensure `exchanged_auth_credential.oauth2.redirect_uri` contains the redirect URI you used.  
* Create a `types.Content` object containing a `types.Part` with a `types.FunctionResponse`.  
      * Set `name` to `"adk_request_credential"`. (Note: This is a special name for ADK to proceed with authentication. Do not use other names.)  
      * Set `id` to the `auth_request_function_call_id` you saved.  
      * Set `response` to the *serialized* (e.g., `.model_dump()`) updated `AuthConfig` object.  
* Call `runner.run_async` **again** for the same session, passing this `FunctionResponse` content as the `new_message`.

```py
# (Continuing after user interaction)

    # Simulate getting the callback URL (e.g., from user paste or web handler)
    auth_response_uri = await get_user_input(
        f'Paste the full callback URL here:\n> '
    )
    auth_response_uri = auth_response_uri.strip() # Clean input

    if not auth_response_uri:
        print("Callback URL not provided. Aborting.")
        return

    # Update the received AuthConfig with the callback details
    auth_config.exchanged_auth_credential.oauth2.auth_response_uri = auth_response_uri
    # Also include the redirect_uri used, as the token exchange might need it
    auth_config.exchanged_auth_credential.oauth2.redirect_uri = redirect_uri

    # Construct the FunctionResponse Content object
    auth_content = types.Content(
        role='user', # Role can be 'user' when sending a FunctionResponse
        parts=[
            types.Part(
                function_response=types.FunctionResponse(
                    id=auth_request_function_call_id,       # Link to the original request
                    name='adk_request_credential', # Special framework function name
                    response=auth_config.model_dump() # Send back the *updated* AuthConfig
                )
            )
        ],
    )

    # --- Resume Execution ---
    print("\nSubmitting authentication details back to the agent...")
    events_async_after_auth = runner.run_async(
        session_id=session.id,
        user_id='user',
        new_message=auth_content, # Send the FunctionResponse back
    )

    # --- Process Final Agent Output ---
    print("\n--- Agent Response after Authentication ---")
    async for event in events_async_after_auth:
        # Process events normally, expecting the tool call to succeed now
        print(event) # Print the full event for inspection

```

!!! note "Note: Authorization response with Resume feature"

    If your ADK agent workflow is configured with the 
    [Resume](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/) feature, you also must include
    the Invocation ID (`invocation_id`) parameter with the authorization
    response. The Invocation ID you provide must be the same invocation
    that generated the authorization request, otherwise the system
    starts a new invocation with the authorization response. If your
    agent uses the Resume feature, consider including the Invocation ID
    as a parameter with your authorization request, so it can be included
    with the authorization response. For more details on using the Resume 
    feature, see
    [Resume stopped agents](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/).

**Step 5: ADK Handles Token Exchange & Tool Retry and gets Tool result**

* ADK receives the `FunctionResponse` for `adk_request_credential`.  
* It uses the information in the updated `AuthConfig` (including the callback URL containing the code) to perform the OAuth **token exchange** with the provider's token endpoint, obtaining the access token (and possibly refresh token).  
* ADK internally makes these tokens available by setting them in the session state).  
* ADK **automatically retries** the original tool call (the one that initially failed due to missing auth).  
* This time, the tool finds the valid tokens (via `tool_context.get_auth_response()`) and successfully executes the authenticated API call.  
* The agent receives the actual result from the tool and generates its final response to the user.

---

The sequence diagram of auth response flow (where Agent Client send back the auth response and ADK retries tool calling) looks like below:

![Authentication](../assets/auth_part2.svg)

## Journey 2: Building Custom Tools (`FunctionTool`) Requiring Authentication

This section focuses on implementing the authentication logic *inside* your custom Python function when creating a new ADK Tool. We will implement a `FunctionTool` as an example.

### Prerequisites

Your function signature *must* include [`tool_context: ToolContext`](../tools/index.md#tool-context). ADK automatically injects this object, providing access to state and auth mechanisms.

```py
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool, ToolContext
from typing import Dict

def my_authenticated_tool_function(param1: str, ..., tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    # ... your logic ...
    pass

my_tool = FunctionTool(func=my_authenticated_tool_function)

```

### Authentication Logic within the Tool Function

Implement the following steps inside your function:

**Step 1: Check for Cached & Valid Credentials:**

Inside your tool function, first check if valid credentials (e.g., access/refresh tokens) are already stored from a previous run in this session. Credentials for the current sessions should be stored in `tool_context.invocation_context.session.state` (a dictionary of state) Check existence of existing credentials by checking `tool_context.invocation_context.session.state.get(credential_name, None)`.

```py
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# Inside your tool function
TOKEN_CACHE_KEY = "my_tool_tokens" # Choose a unique key
SCOPES = ["scope1", "scope2"] # Define required scopes

creds = None
cached_token_info = tool_context.state.get(TOKEN_CACHE_KEY)
if cached_token_info:
    try:
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_info(cached_token_info, SCOPES)
        if not creds.valid and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
            tool_context.state[TOKEN_CACHE_KEY] = json.loads(creds.to_json()) # Update cache
        elif not creds.valid:
            creds = None # Invalid, needs re-auth
            tool_context.state[TOKEN_CACHE_KEY] = None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading/refreshing cached creds: {e}")
        creds = None
        tool_context.state[TOKEN_CACHE_KEY] = None

if creds and creds.valid:
    # Skip to Step 5: Make Authenticated API Call
    pass
else:
    # Proceed to Step 2...
    pass

```

**Step 2: Check for Auth Response from Client**

* If Step 1 didn't yield valid credentials, check if the client just completed the interactive flow by calling `exchanged_credential = tool_context.get_auth_response()`.  
* This returns the updated `exchanged_credential` object sent back by the client (containing the callback URL in `auth_response_uri`).

```py
# Use auth_scheme and auth_credential configured in the tool.
# exchanged_credential: AuthCredential | None

exchanged_credential = tool_context.get_auth_response(AuthConfig(
  auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
  raw_auth_credential=auth_credential,
))
# If exchanged_credential is not None, then there is already an exchanged credetial from the auth response. 
if exchanged_credential:
   # ADK exchanged the access token already for us
        access_token = exchanged_credential.oauth2.access_token
        refresh_token = exchanged_credential.oauth2.refresh_token
        creds = Credentials(
            token=access_token,
            refresh_token=refresh_token,
            token_uri=auth_scheme.flows.authorizationCode.tokenUrl,
            client_id=auth_credential.oauth2.client_id,
            client_secret=auth_credential.oauth2.client_secret,
            scopes=list(auth_scheme.flows.authorizationCode.scopes.keys()),
        )
    # Cache the token in session state and call the API, skip to step 5
```

**Step 3: Initiate Authentication Request**

If no valid credentials (Step 1.) and no auth response (Step 2.) are found, the tool needs to start the OAuth flow. Define the AuthScheme and initial AuthCredential and call `tool_context.request_credential()`. Return a response indicating authorization is needed.

```py
# Use auth_scheme and auth_credential configured in the tool.

  tool_context.request_credential(AuthConfig(
    auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
    raw_auth_credential=auth_credential,
  ))
  return {'pending': true, 'message': 'Awaiting user authentication.'}

# By setting request_credential, ADK detects a pending authentication event. It pauses execution and ask end user to login.
```

**Step 4: Exchange Authorization Code for Tokens**

ADK automatically generates oauth authorization URL and presents it to your Agent Client application. your Agent Client application should follow the same way described in Journey 1 to redirect the user to the authorization URL (with `redirect_uri` appended). Once a user completes the login flow following the authorization URL and ADK extracts the authentication callback url from Agent Client applications, automatically parses the auth code, and generates auth token. At the next Tool call, `tool_context.get_auth_response` in step 2 will contain a valid credential to use in subsequent API calls.

**Step 5: Cache Obtained Credentials**

After successfully obtaining the token from ADK (Step 2) or if the token is still valid (Step 1), **immediately store** the new `Credentials` object in `tool_context.state` (serialized, e.g., as JSON) using your cache key.

```py
# Inside your tool function, after obtaining 'creds' (either refreshed or newly exchanged)
# Cache the new/refreshed tokens
tool_context.state[TOKEN_CACHE_KEY] = json.loads(creds.to_json())
print(f"DEBUG: Cached/updated tokens under key: {TOKEN_CACHE_KEY}")
# Proceed to Step 6 (Make API Call)

```

**Step 6: Make Authenticated API Call**

* Once you have a valid `Credentials` object (`creds` from Step 1 or Step 4), use it to make the actual call to the protected API using the appropriate client library (e.g., `googleapiclient`, `requests`). Pass the `credentials=creds` argument.  
* Include error handling, especially for `HttpError` 401/403, which might mean the token expired or was revoked between calls. If you get such an error, consider clearing the cached token (`tool_context.state.pop(...)`) and potentially returning the `auth_required` status again to force re-authentication.

```py
# Inside your tool function, using the valid 'creds' object
# Ensure creds is valid before proceeding
if not creds or not creds.valid:
   return {"status": "error", "error_message": "Cannot proceed without valid credentials."}

try:
   service = build("calendar", "v3", credentials=creds) # Example
   api_result = service.events().list(...).execute()
   # Proceed to Step 7
except Exception as e:
   # Handle API errors (e.g., check for 401/403, maybe clear cache and re-request auth)
   print(f"ERROR: API call failed: {e}")
   return {"status": "error", "error_message": f"API call failed: {e}"}
```

**Step 7: Return Tool Result**

* After a successful API call, process the result into a dictionary format that is useful for the LLM.  
* **Crucially, include a**  along with the data.

```py
# Inside your tool function, after successful API call
    processed_result = [...] # Process api_result for the LLM
    return {"status": "success", "data": processed_result}

```

# Built-in tools

These built-in tools provide ready-to-use functionality such as Google Search or
code executors that provide agents with common capabilities. For instance, an
agent that needs to retrieve information from the web can directly use the
**google\_search** tool without any additional setup.

## How to Use

1. **Import:** Import the desired tool from the tools module. This is `agents.tools` in Python or `com.google.adk.tools` in Java.
2. **Configure:** Initialize the tool, providing required parameters if any.
3. **Register:** Add the initialized tool to the **tools** list of your Agent.

Once added to an agent, the agent can decide to use the tool based on the **user
prompt** and its **instructions**. The framework handles the execution of the
tool when the agent calls it. Important: check the ***Limitations*** section of this page.

## Available Built-in tools

Note: Java only supports Google Search and Code Execution tools currently.

### Google Search

The `google_search` tool allows the agent to perform web searches using Google Search. The `google_search` tool is only compatible with Gemini 2 models. For further details of the tool, see [Understanding Google Search grounding](../grounding/google_search_grounding.md).

!!! warning "Additional requirements when using the `google_search` tool"
    When you use grounding with Google Search, and you receive Search suggestions in your response, you must display the Search suggestions in production and in your applications.
    For more information on grounding with Google Search, see Grounding with Google Search documentation for [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding/search-suggestions) or [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/grounding-search-suggestions). The UI code (HTML) is returned in the Gemini response as `renderedContent`, and you will need to show the HTML in your app, in accordance with the policy.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/built-in-tools/google_search.py"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/GoogleSearchAgentApp.java:full_code"
    ```

### Code Execution

The `built_in_code_execution` tool enables the agent to execute code,
specifically when using Gemini 2 models. This allows the model to perform tasks
like calculations, data manipulation, or running small scripts.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/built-in-tools/code_execution.py"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/CodeExecutionAgentApp.java:full_code"
    ```

### GKE Code Executor

The GKE Code Executor (`GkeCodeExecutor`) provides a secure and scalable method
for running LLM-generated code by leveraging the GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
Sandbox environment, which uses gVisor for workload isolation. For each code
execution request, it dynamically creates an ephemeral, sandboxed Kubernetes Job
with a hardened Pod configuration. You should use this executor for production
environments on GKE where security and isolation are critical.

#### How it Works

When a request to execute code is made, the `GkeCodeExecutor` performs the following steps:

1.  **Creates a ConfigMap:** A Kubernetes ConfigMap is created to store the Python code that needs to be executed.
2.  **Creates a Sandboxed Pod:** A new Kubernetes Job is created, which in turn creates a Pod with a hardened security context and the gVisor runtime enabled. The code from the ConfigMap is mounted into this Pod.
3.  **Executes the Code:** The code is executed within the sandboxed Pod, isolated from the underlying node and other workloads.
4.  **Retrieves the Result:** The standard output and error streams from the execution are captured from the Pod's logs.
5.  **Cleans Up Resources:** Once the execution is complete, the Job and the associated ConfigMap are automatically deleted, ensuring that no artifacts are left behind.

#### Key Benefits

*   **Enhanced Security:** Code is executed in a gVisor-sandboxed environment with kernel-level isolation.
*   **Ephemeral Environments:** Each code execution runs in its own ephemeral Pod, to prevent state transfer between executions.
*   **Resource Control:** You can configure CPU and memory limits for the execution Pods to prevent resource abuse.
*   **Scalability:** Allows you to run a large number of code executions in parallel, with GKE handling the scheduling and scaling of the underlying nodes.

#### System requirements

The following requirements must be met to successfully deploy your ADK project
with the GKE Code Executor tool:

- GKE cluster with a **gVisor-enabled node pool**.
- Agent's service account requires specific **RBAC permissions**, which allow it to:
    - Create, watch, and delete **Jobs** for each execution request.
    - Manage **ConfigMaps** to inject code into the Job's pod.
    - List **Pods** and read their **logs** to retrieve the execution result
- Install the client library with GKE extras: `pip install google-adk[gke]`

For a complete, ready-to-use configuration, see the 
[deployment_rbac.yaml](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/contributing/samples/gke_agent_sandbox/deployment_rbac.yaml)
sample. For more information on deploying ADK workflows to GKE, see
[Deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](/adk-docs/deploy/gke/).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.code_executors import GkeCodeExecutor

    # Initialize the executor, targeting the namespace where its ServiceAccount
    # has the required RBAC permissions.
    # This example also sets a custom timeout and resource limits.
    gke_executor = GkeCodeExecutor(
        namespace="agent-sandbox",
        timeout_seconds=600,
        cpu_limit="1000m",  # 1 CPU core
        mem_limit="1Gi",
    )

    # The agent now uses this executor for any code it generates.
    gke_agent = LlmAgent(
        name="gke_coding_agent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        instruction="You are a helpful AI agent that writes and executes Python code.",
        code_executor=gke_executor,
    )
    ```

#### Configuration parameters

The `GkeCodeExecutor` can be configured with the following parameters:

### Vertex AI RAG Engine

The `vertex_ai_rag_retrieval` tool allows the agent to perform private data retrieval using Vertex
AI RAG Engine.

When you use grounding with Vertex AI RAG Engine, you need to prepare a RAG corpus before hand.
Please refer to the [RAG ADK agent sample](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/main/python/agents/RAG/rag/shared_libraries/prepare_corpus_and_data.py) or [Vertex AI RAG Engine page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/rag-engine/rag-quickstart) for setting it up.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/built-in-tools/vertexai_rag_engine.py"
    ```

### Vertex AI Search

The `vertex_ai_search_tool` uses Google Cloud Vertex AI Search, enabling the
agent to search across your private, configured data stores (e.g., internal
documents, company policies, knowledge bases). This built-in tool requires you
to provide the specific data store ID during configuration. For further details of the tool, see [Understanding Vertex AI Search grounding](../grounding/vertex_ai_search_grounding.md).


```py
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/built-in-tools/vertexai_search.py"
```

## Use Built-in tools with other tools

The following code sample demonstrates how to use multiple built-in tools or how
to use built-in tools with other tools by using multiple agents:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from google.adk.tools.agent_tool import AgentTool
    from google.adk.agents import Agent
    from google.adk.tools import google_search
    from google.adk.code_executors import BuiltInCodeExecutor
    

    search_agent = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='SearchAgent',
        instruction="""
        You're a specialist in Google Search
        """,
        tools=[google_search],
    )
    coding_agent = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='CodeAgent',
        instruction="""
        You're a specialist in Code Execution
        """,
        code_executor=BuiltInCodeExecutor(),
    )
    root_agent = Agent(
        name="RootAgent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="Root Agent",
        tools=[AgentTool(agent=search_agent), AgentTool(agent=coding_agent)],
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.BaseAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.tools.AgentTool;
    import com.google.adk.tools.BuiltInCodeExecutionTool;
    import com.google.adk.tools.GoogleSearchTool;
    import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
    
    public class NestedAgentApp {
    
      private static final String MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash";
    
      public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Define the SearchAgent
        LlmAgent searchAgent =
            LlmAgent.builder()
                .model(MODEL_ID)
                .name("SearchAgent")
                .instruction("You're a specialist in Google Search")
                .tools(new GoogleSearchTool()) // Instantiate GoogleSearchTool
                .build();
    

        // Define the CodingAgent
        LlmAgent codingAgent =
            LlmAgent.builder()
                .model(MODEL_ID)
                .name("CodeAgent")
                .instruction("You're a specialist in Code Execution")
                .tools(new BuiltInCodeExecutionTool()) // Instantiate BuiltInCodeExecutionTool
                .build();

        // Define the RootAgent, which uses AgentTool.create() to wrap SearchAgent and CodingAgent
        BaseAgent rootAgent =
            LlmAgent.builder()
                .name("RootAgent")
                .model(MODEL_ID)
                .description("Root Agent")
                .tools(
                    AgentTool.create(searchAgent), // Use create method
                    AgentTool.create(codingAgent)   // Use create method
                 )
                .build();

        // Note: This sample only demonstrates the agent definitions.
        // To run these agents, you'd need to integrate them with a Runner and SessionService,
        // similar to the previous examples.
        System.out.println("Agents defined successfully:");
        System.out.println("  Root Agent: " + rootAgent.name());
        System.out.println("  Search Agent (nested): " + searchAgent.name());
        System.out.println("  Code Agent (nested): " + codingAgent.name());
      }
    }
    ```


### Limitations

!!! warning

    Currently, for each root agent or single agent, only one built-in tool is
    supported. No other tools of any type can be used in the same agent.

 For example, the following approach that uses ***a built-in tool along with
 other tools*** within a single agent is **not** currently supported:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    root_agent = Agent(
        name="RootAgent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="Root Agent",
        tools=[custom_function], 
        code_executor=BuiltInCodeExecutor() # <-- not supported when used with tools
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
     LlmAgent searchAgent =
            LlmAgent.builder()
                .model(MODEL_ID)
                .name("SearchAgent")
                .instruction("You're a specialist in Google Search")
                .tools(new GoogleSearchTool(), new YourCustomTool()) // <-- not supported
                .build();
    ```

ADK Python has a built-in workaroud which bypasses this limitation for 
`GoogleSearchTool` and `VertexAiSearchTool` (use `bypass_multi_tools_limit=True` to enable it), e.g.
[sample agent](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/built_in_multi_tools).

!!! warning

    Built-in tools cannot be used within a sub-agent, with the exception of
    `GoogleSearchTool` and `VertexAiSearchTool` in ADK Python because of the
    workaround mentioned above.

For example, the following approach that uses built-in tools within sub-agents
is **not** currently supported:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    url_context_agent = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='UrlContextAgent',
        instruction="""
        You're a specialist in URL Context
        """,
        tools=[url_context],
    )
    coding_agent = Agent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='CodeAgent',
        instruction="""
        You're a specialist in Code Execution
        """,
        code_executor=BuiltInCodeExecutor(),
    )
    root_agent = Agent(
        name="RootAgent",
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        description="Root Agent",
        sub_agents=[
            url_context_agent,
            coding_agent
        ],
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    LlmAgent searchAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .name("SearchAgent")
            .instruction("You're a specialist in Google Search")
            .tools(new GoogleSearchTool())
            .build();

    LlmAgent codingAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .name("CodeAgent")
            .instruction("You're a specialist in Code Execution")
            .tools(new BuiltInCodeExecutionTool())
            .build();
    

    LlmAgent rootAgent =
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .name("RootAgent")
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .description("Root Agent")
            .subAgents(searchAgent, codingAgent) // Not supported, as the sub agents use built in tools.
            .build();
    ```

# Get action confirmation for ADK Tools

Some agent workflows require confirmation for decision making, verification,
security, or general oversight. In these cases, you want to get a response from
a human or supervising system before proceeding with a workflow. The *Tool
Confirmation* feature in the Agent Development Kit (ADK) allows an ADK Tool to
pause its execution and interact with a user or other system for confirmation or
to gather structured data before proceeding. You can use Tool Confirmation with
an ADK Tool in the following ways:

-   **[Boolean Confirmation](#boolean-confirmation):** You can
    configure a FunctionTool with a `require_confirmation` parameter. This
    option pauses the tool for a yes or no confirmation response.
-   **[Advanced Confirmation](#advanced-confirmation):** For scenarios requiring
    structured data responses, you can configure a `FunctionTool` with a text
    prompt to explain the confirmation and an expected response.

!!! example "Experimental"
    The Tool Confirmation feature is experimental and has some
    [known limitations](#known-limitations).
    We welcome your
    [feedback](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&labels=tool%20confirmation)!

You can configure how a request is communicated to a user, and the system can
also use [remote responses](#remote-response) sent via the ADK
server's REST API. When using the confirmation feature with the ADK web user
interface, the agent workflow displays a dialog box to the user to request
input, as shown in Figure 1:

![Screenshot of default user interface for tool confirmation](/adk-docs/assets/confirmation-ui.png)

**Figure 1.** Example confirmation response request dialog box using an
advanced, tool response implementation.

The following sections describe how to use this feature for the confirmation
scenarios. For a complete code sample, see the
[human_tool_confirmation](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fc90ce968f114f84b14829f8117797a4c256d710/contributing/samples/human_tool_confirmation/agent.py)
example. There are additional ways to incorporate human input into your agent
workflow, for more details, see the
[Human-in-the-loop](/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/#human-in-the-loop-pattern)
agent pattern.

## Boolean confirmation {#boolean-confirmation}

When your tool only requires a simple `yes` or `no` from the user, you can
append a confirmation step using the `FunctionTool` class as a wrapper. For
example, if you have a tool called `reimburse`, you can enable a confirmation
step by wrapping it with the `FunctionTool` class and setting the
`require_confirmation` parameter to `True`, as shown in the following example:

```
# From agent.py
root_agent = Agent(
   ...
   tools=[
        # Set require_confirmation to True to require user confirmation
        # for the tool call.
        FunctionTool(reimburse, require_confirmation=True),
    ],
...
```

This implementation method requires minimal code, but is limited to simple
approvals from the user or confirming system. For a complete example of this
approach, see the
[human_tool_confirmation](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fc90ce968f114f84b14829f8117797a4c256d710/contributing/samples/human_tool_confirmation/agent.py)
code sample.

### Require confirmation function

You can modify the behavior `require_confirmation` response by replacing its
input value with a function that returns a boolean response. The following
example shows a function for determining if a confirmation is required:

```
async def confirmation_threshold(
    amount: int, tool_context: ToolContext
) -> bool:
  """Returns true if the amount is greater than 1000."""
  return amount > 1000
```

This function than then be set as the parameter value for the
`require_confirmation` parameter:

```
root_agent = Agent(
   ...
   tools=[
        # Set require_confirmation to True to require user confirmation
        FunctionTool(reimburse, require_confirmation=confirmation_threshold),
    ],
...
```

For a complete example of this implementation, see the
[human_tool_confirmation](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fc90ce968f114f84b14829f8117797a4c256d710/contributing/samples/human_tool_confirmation/agent.py)
code sample.

## Advanced confirmation {#advanced-confirmation}

When a tool confirmation requires more details for the user or a more complex
response, use a tool_confirmation implementation. This approach extends the
`ToolContext` object to add a text description of the request for the user and
allows for more complex response data. When implementing tool confirmation this
way, you can pause a tool's execution, request specific information, and then
resume the tool with the provided data.

This confirmation flow has a request stage where the system assembles and sends
an input request human response, and a response stage where the system receives
and processes the returned data.

### Confirmation definition

When creating a Tool with an advanced confirmation, create a function that
includes a ToolContext object. Then define the confirmation using a
tool_confirmation object, the `tool_context.request_confirmation()` method with
`hint` and `payload` parameters. These properties are used as follows:

-   `hint`: Descriptive message that explains what is needed from the user.
-   `payload`: The structure of the data you expect in return. This data
    type is Any and must be serializable into a JSON-formatted string, such as
    a dictionary or pydantic model.

The following code shows an example implementation for a tool that processes
time off requests for an employee:

```
def request_time_off(days: int, tool_context: ToolContext):
  """Request day off for the employee."""
  ...
  tool_confirmation = tool_context.tool_confirmation
  if not tool_confirmation:
    tool_context.request_confirmation(
        hint=(
            'Please approve or reject the tool call request_time_off() by'
            ' responding with a FunctionResponse with an expected'
            ' ToolConfirmation payload.'
        ),
        payload={
            'approved_days': 0,
        },
    )
    # Return intermediate status indicating that the tool is waiting for
    # a confirmation response:
    return {'status': 'Manager approval is required.'}

  approved_days = tool_confirmation.payload['approved_days']
  approved_days = min(approved_days, days)
  if approved_days == 0:
    return {'status': 'The time off request is rejected.', 'approved_days': 0}
  return {
      'status': 'ok',
      'approved_days': approved_days,
  }
```

For a complete example of this approach, see the
[human_tool_confirmation](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fc90ce968f114f84b14829f8117797a4c256d710/contributing/samples/human_tool_confirmation/agent.py)
code sample. Keep in mind that the agent workflow tool execution pauses while a
confirmation is obtained. After confirmation is received, you can access the
confirmation response in the `tool_confirmation.payload` object and then proceed
with the execution of the workflow.

## Remote confirmation with REST API {#remote-response}

If there is no active user interface for a human confirmation of an agent
workflow, you can handle the confirmation through a command-line interface or by
routing it through another channel like email or a chat application. To confirm
the tool call, the user or calling application needs to send a
`FunctionResponse` event with the tool confirmation data.

You can send the request to the ADK API server's `/run` or `/run_sse` endpoint,
or directly to the ADK runner. The following example uses a  `curl` command to
send the confirmation to the  `/run_sse` endpoint:

```
 curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
    "app_name": "human_tool_confirmation",
    "user_id": "user",
    "session_id": "7828f575-2402-489f-8079-74ea95b6a300",
    "new_message": {
        "parts": [
            {
                "function_response": {
                    "id": "adk-13b84a8c-c95c-4d66-b006-d72b30447e35",
                    "name": "adk_request_confirmation",
                    "response": {
                        "confirmed": true
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        "role": "user"
    }
}'
```

A REST-based response for a confirmation must meet the following
requirements:

-   The `id` in the `function_response` should match the `function_call_id`
    from the `RequestConfirmation` `FunctionCall` event.
-   The `name` should be `adk_request_confirmation`.
-   The `response` object contains the confirmation status and any
    additional payload data required by the tool.

!!! note "Note: Confirmation with Resume feature"

    If your ADK agent workflow is configured with the 
    [Resume](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/) feature, you also must include
    the Invocation ID (`invocation_id`) parameter with the confirmation
    response. The Invocation ID you provide must be the same invocation
    that generated the confirmation request, otherwise the system
    starts a new invocation with the confirmation response. If your
    agent uses the Resume feature, consider including the Invocation ID
    as a parameter with your confirmation request, so it can be
    included with the response. For more details on using the Resume
    feature, see
    [Resume stopped agents](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/).

## Known limitations {#known-limitations}

The tool confirmation feature has the following limitations:

-   [DatabaseSessionService](/adk-docs/api-reference/python/google-adk.html#google.adk.sessions.DatabaseSessionService)
    is not supported by this feature.
-   [VertexAiSessionService](/adk-docs/api-reference/python/google-adk.html#google.adk.sessions.VertexAiSessionService)
    is not supported by this feature.

# Function tools

When pre-built ADK tools don't meet your requirements, you can create custom *function tools*. Building function tools allows you to create tailored functionality, such as connecting to proprietary databases or implementing unique algorithms.
For example, a function tool, `myfinancetool`, might be a function that calculates a specific financial metric. ADK also supports long running functions, so if that calculation takes a while, the agent can continue working on other tasks.

ADK offers several ways to create functions tools, each suited to different levels of complexity and control:

*  [Function Tools](#function-tool)
*  [Long Running Function Tools](#long-run-tool)
*  [Agents-as-a-Tool](#agent-tool)

## Function Tools {#function-tool}

Transforming a Python function into a tool is a straightforward way to integrate custom logic into your agents. When you assign a function to an agent’s `tools` list, the framework automatically wraps it as a `FunctionTool`.

### How it Works

The ADK framework automatically inspects your Python function's signature—including its name, docstring, parameters, type hints, and default values—to generate a schema. This schema is what the LLM uses to understand the tool's purpose, when to use it, and what arguments it requires.

### Defining Function Signatures

A well-defined function signature is crucial for the LLM to use your tool correctly.

#### Parameters

You can define functions with required parameters, optional parameters, and variadic arguments. Here’s how each is handled:

##### Required Parameters
A parameter is considered **required** if it has a type hint but **no default value**. The LLM must provide a value for this argument when it calls the tool.

???+ "Example: Required Parameters"
    === "Python"
        ```python
        def get_weather(city: str, unit: str):
            """
            Retrieves the weather for a city in the specified unit.

            Args:
                city (str): The city name.
                unit (str): The temperature unit, either 'Celsius' or 'Fahrenheit'.
            """
            # ... function logic ...
            return {"status": "success", "report": f"Weather for {city} is sunny."}
        ```
    In this example, both `city` and `unit` are mandatory. If the LLM tries to call `get_weather` without one of them, the ADK will return an error to the LLM, prompting it to correct the call.

##### Optional Parameters with Default Values
A parameter is considered **optional** if you provide a **default value**. This is the standard Python way to define optional arguments. The ADK correctly interprets these and does not list them in the `required` field of the tool schema sent to the LLM.

???+ "Example: Optional Parameter with Default Value"
    === "Python"
        ```python
        def search_flights(destination: str, departure_date: str, flexible_days: int = 0):
            """
            Searches for flights.

            Args:
                destination (str): The destination city.
                departure_date (str): The desired departure date.
                flexible_days (int, optional): Number of flexible days for the search. Defaults to 0.
            """
            # ... function logic ...
            if flexible_days > 0:
                return {"status": "success", "report": f"Found flexible flights to {destination}."}
            return {"status": "success", "report": f"Found flights to {destination} on {departure_date}."}
        ```
    Here, `flexible_days` is optional. The LLM can choose to provide it, but it's not required.

##### Optional Parameters with `typing.Optional`
You can also mark a parameter as optional using `typing.Optional[SomeType]` or the `| None` syntax (Python 3.10+). This signals that the parameter can be `None`. When combined with a default value of `None`, it behaves as a standard optional parameter.

???+ "Example: `typing.Optional`"
    === "Python"
        ```python
        from typing import Optional

        def create_user_profile(username: str, bio: Optional[str] = None):
            """
            Creates a new user profile.

            Args:
                username (str): The user's unique username.
                bio (str, optional): A short biography for the user. Defaults to None.
            """
            # ... function logic ...
            if bio:
                return {"status": "success", "message": f"Profile for {username} created with a bio."}
            return {"status": "success", "message": f"Profile for {username} created."}
        ```

##### Variadic Parameters (`*args` and `**kwargs`)
While you can include `*args` (variable positional arguments) and `**kwargs` (variable keyword arguments) in your function signature for other purposes, they are **ignored by the ADK framework** when generating the tool schema for the LLM. The LLM will not be aware of them and cannot pass arguments to them. It's best to rely on explicitly defined parameters for all data you expect from the LLM.

#### Return Type

The preferred return type for a Function Tool is a **dictionary** in Python or **Map** in Java. This allows you to structure the response with key-value pairs, providing context and clarity to the LLM. If your function returns a type other than a dictionary, the framework automatically wraps it into a dictionary with a single key named **"result"**.

Strive to make your return values as descriptive as possible. *For example,* instead of returning a numeric error code, return a dictionary with an "error_message" key containing a human-readable explanation. **Remember that the LLM**, not a piece of code, needs to understand the result. As a best practice, include a "status" key in your return dictionary to indicate the overall outcome (e.g., "success", "error", "pending"), providing the LLM with a clear signal about the operation's state.

#### Docstrings

The docstring of your function serves as the tool's **description** and is sent to the LLM. Therefore, a well-written and comprehensive docstring is crucial for the LLM to understand how to use the tool effectively. Clearly explain the purpose of the function, the meaning of its parameters, and the expected return values.

### Passing Data Between Tools

When an agent calls multiple tools in a sequence, you might need to pass data from one tool to another. The recommended way to do this is by using the `temp:` prefix in the session state.

A tool can write data to a `temp:` variable, and a subsequent tool can read it. This data is only available for the current invocation and is discarded afterwards.

!!! note "Shared Invocation Context"
    All tool calls within a single agent turn share the same `InvocationContext`. This means they also share the same temporary (`temp:`) state, which is how data can be passed between them.

### Example

??? "Example"

    === "Python"
    
        This tool is a python function which obtains the Stock price of a given Stock ticker/ symbol.
    
        <u>Note</u>: You need to `pip install yfinance` library before using this tool.
    
        ```py
        --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/function-tools/func_tool.py"
        ```
    
        The return value from this tool will be wrapped into a dictionary.
    
        ```json
        {"result": "$123"}
        ```
    
    === "Java"
    
        This tool retrieves the mocked value of a stock price.
    
        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/StockPriceAgent.java:full_code"
        ```
    
        The return value from this tool will be wrapped into a Map<String, Object>.
    
        ```json
        For input `GOOG`: {"symbol": "GOOG", "price": "1.0"}
        ```

### Best Practices

While you have considerable flexibility in defining your function, remember that simplicity enhances usability for the LLM. Consider these guidelines:

* **Fewer Parameters are Better:** Minimize the number of parameters to reduce complexity.  
* **Simple Data Types:** Favor primitive data types like `str` and `int` over custom classes whenever possible.  
* **Meaningful Names:** The function's name and parameter names significantly influence how the LLM interprets and utilizes the tool. Choose names that clearly reflect the function's purpose and the meaning of its inputs. Avoid generic names like `do_stuff()` or `beAgent()`.
* **Build for Parallel Execution:** Improve function calling performance when multiple tools are run by building for asynchronous operation. For information on enabling parallel execution for tools, see
[Increase tool performance with parallel execution](/adk-docs/tools/performance/).

## Long Running Function Tools {#long-run-tool}

This tool is designed to help you start and manage tasks that are handled outside the operation of your agent workflow, and require a significant amount of processing time, without blocking the agent's execution. This tool is a subclass of `FunctionTool`.

When using a `LongRunningFunctionTool`, your function can initiate the long-running operation and optionally return an **initial result**, such as a long-running operation id. Once a long running function tool is invoked the agent runner pauses the agent run and lets the agent client to decide whether to continue or wait until the long-running operation finishes. The agent client can query the progress of the long-running operation and send back an intermediate or final response. The agent can then continue with other tasks. An example is the human-in-the-loop scenario where the agent needs human approval before proceeding with a task.

!!! warning "Warning: Execution handling"
    Long Running Function Tools are designed to help you start and *manage* long running
    tasks as part of your agent workflow, but ***not perform*** the actual, long task.
    For tasks that require significant time to complete, you should implement a separate
    server to do the task.

!!! tip "Tip: Parallel execution"
    Depending on the type of tool you are building, designing for asychronous
    operation may be a better solution than creating a long running tool. For
    more information, see
    [Increase tool performance with parallel execution](/adk-docs/tools/performance/).

### How it Works

In Python, you wrap a function with `LongRunningFunctionTool`.  In Java, you pass a Method name to `LongRunningFunctionTool.create()`.


1. **Initiation:** When the LLM calls the tool, your function starts the long-running operation.

2. **Initial Updates:** Your function should optionally return an initial result (e.g. the long-running operaiton id). The ADK framework takes the result and sends it back to the LLM packaged within a `FunctionResponse`. This allows the LLM to inform the user (e.g., status, percentage complete, messages). And then the agent run is ended / paused.

3. **Continue or Wait:** After each agent run is completed. Agent client can query the progress of the long-running operation and decide whether to continue the agent run with an intermediate response (to update the progress) or wait until a final response is retrieved. Agent client should send the intermediate or final response back to the agent for the next run.

4. **Framework Handling:** The ADK framework manages the execution. It sends the intermediate or final `FunctionResponse` sent by agent client to the LLM to generate a user friendly message.

### Creating the Tool

Define your tool function and wrap it using the `LongRunningFunctionTool` class:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/function-tools/human_in_the_loop.py:define_long_running_function"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
    import com.google.adk.tools.LongRunningFunctionTool;
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Map;
    
    public class ExampleLongRunningFunction {
    
      // Define your Long Running function.
      // Ask for approval for the reimbursement.
      public static Map<String, Object> askForApproval(String purpose, double amount) {
        // Simulate creating a ticket and sending a notification
        System.out.println(
            "Simulating ticket creation for purpose: " + purpose + ", amount: " + amount);
    
        // Send a notification to the approver with the link of the ticket
        Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>();
        result.put("status", "pending");
        result.put("approver", "Sean Zhou");
        result.put("purpose", purpose);
        result.put("amount", amount);
        result.put("ticket-id", "approval-ticket-1");
        return result;
      }
    
      public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchMethodException {
        // Pass the method to LongRunningFunctionTool.create
        LongRunningFunctionTool approveTool =
            LongRunningFunctionTool.create(ExampleLongRunningFunction.class, "askForApproval");
    
        // Include the tool in the agent
        LlmAgent approverAgent =
            LlmAgent.builder()
                // ...
                .tools(approveTool)
                .build();
      }
    }
    ```

### Intermediate / Final result Updates

Agent client received an event with long running function calls and check the status of the ticket. Then Agent client can send the intermediate or final response back to update the progress. The framework packages this value (even if it's None) into the content of the `FunctionResponse` sent back to the LLM.

!!! note "Note: Long running function response with Resume feature"

    If your ADK agent workflow is configured with the 
    [Resume](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/) feature, you also must include
    the Invocation ID (`invocation_id`) parameter with the long running 
    function response. The Invocation ID you provide must be the same 
    invocation that generated the long running function request, otherwise 
    the system starts a new invocation with the response. If your
    agent uses the Resume feature, consider including the Invocation ID
    as a parameter with your long running function request, so it can be
    included with the response. For more details on using the Resume 
    feature, see
    [Resume stopped agents](/adk-docs/runtime/resume/).

??? Tip "Applies to only Java ADK"

    When passing `ToolContext` with Function Tools, ensure that one of the following is true:

    * The Schema is passed with the ToolContext parameter in the function signature, like:
      ```
      @com.google.adk.tools.Annotations.Schema(name = "toolContext") ToolContext toolContext
      ```
    OR

    * The following `-parameters` flag is set to the mvn compiler plugin

    ```
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.14.0</version> <!-- or newer -->
                <configuration>
                    <compilerArgs>
                        <arg>-parameters</arg>
                    </compilerArgs>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ```
    This constraint is temporary and will be removed.


=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/function-tools/human_in_the_loop.py:call_reimbursement_tool"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/LongRunningFunctionExample.java:full_code"
    ```


??? "Python complete example: File Processing Simulation"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/function-tools/human_in_the_loop.py"
    ```

#### Key aspects of this example

* **`LongRunningFunctionTool`**: Wraps the supplied method/function; the framework handles sending yielded updates and the final return value as sequential FunctionResponses.

* **Agent instruction**: Directs the LLM to use the tool and understand the incoming FunctionResponse stream (progress vs. completion) for user updates.

* **Final return**: The function returns the final result dictionary, which is sent in the concluding FunctionResponse to indicate completion.

## Agent-as-a-Tool {#agent-tool}

This powerful feature allows you to leverage the capabilities of other agents within your system by calling them as tools. The Agent-as-a-Tool enables you to invoke another agent to perform a specific task, effectively **delegating responsibility**. This is conceptually similar to creating a Python function that calls another agent and uses the agent's response as the function's return value.

### Key difference from sub-agents

It's important to distinguish an Agent-as-a-Tool from a Sub-Agent.

* **Agent-as-a-Tool:** When Agent A calls Agent B as a tool (using Agent-as-a-Tool), Agent B's answer is **passed back** to Agent A, which then summarizes the answer and generates a response to the user. Agent A retains control and continues to handle future user input.  

* **Sub-agent:** When Agent A calls Agent B as a sub-agent, the responsibility of answering the user is completely **transferred to Agent B**. Agent A is effectively out of the loop. All subsequent user input will be answered by Agent B.

### Usage

To use an agent as a tool, wrap the agent with the AgentTool class.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    tools=[AgentTool(agent=agent_b)]
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    AgentTool.create(agent)
    ```

### Customization

The `AgentTool` class provides the following attributes for customizing its behavior:

* **skip\_summarization: bool:** If set to True, the framework will **bypass the LLM-based summarization** of the tool agent's response. This can be useful when the tool's response is already well-formatted and requires no further processing.

??? "Example"

    === "Python"

        ```py
        --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/function-tools/summarizer.py"
        ```
  
    === "Java"

        ```java
        --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/AgentToolCustomization.java:full_code"
        ```

### How it works

1. When the `main_agent` receives the long text, its instruction tells it to use the 'summarize' tool for long texts.  
2. The framework recognizes 'summarize' as an `AgentTool` that wraps the `summary_agent`.  
3. Behind the scenes, the `main_agent` will call the `summary_agent` with the long text as input.  
4. The `summary_agent` will process the text according to its instruction and generate a summary.  
5. **The response from the `summary_agent` is then passed back to the `main_agent`.**  
6. The `main_agent` can then take the summary and formulate its final response to the user (e.g., "Here's a summary of the text: ...")

# Google Cloud Tools

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

Google Cloud tools make it easier to connect your agents to Google Cloud’s
products and services. With just a few lines of code you can use these tools to
connect your agents with:

* **Any custom APIs** that developers host in Apigee.
* **100s** of **prebuilt connectors** to enterprise systems such as Salesforce,
  Workday, and SAP.
* **Automation workflows** built using application integration.
* **Databases** such as Spanner, AlloyDB, Postgres and more using the MCP Toolbox for
  databases.

![Google Cloud Tools](../assets/google_cloud_tools.svg)

## Apigee API Hub Tools

**ApiHubToolset** lets you turn any documented API from Apigee API hub into a
tool with a few lines of code. This section shows you the step by step
instructions including setting up authentication for a secure connection to your
APIs.

**Prerequisites**

1. [Install ADK](../get-started/installation.md)
2. Install the
   [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install?db=bigtable-docs#installation_instructions).
3. [Apigee API hub](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/apihub/what-is-api-hub)
    instance with documented (i.e. OpenAPI spec) APIs
4. Set up your project structure and create required files

```console
project_root_folder
 |
 `-- my_agent
     |-- .env
     |-- __init__.py
     |-- agent.py
     `__ tool.py
```

### Create an API Hub Toolset

Note: This tutorial includes an agent creation. If you already have an agent,
you only need to follow a subset of these steps.

1. Get your access token, so that APIHubToolset can fetch spec from API Hub API.
   In your terminal run the following command

    ```shell
    gcloud auth print-access-token
    # Prints your access token like 'ya29....'
    ```

2. Ensure that the account used has the required permissions. You can use the
   pre-defined role `roles/apihub.viewer` or assign the following permissions:

    1. **apihub.specs.get (required)**
    2. apihub.apis.get (optional)
    3. apihub.apis.list (optional)
    4. apihub.versions.get (optional)
    5. apihub.versions.list (optional)
    6. apihub.specs.list (optional)

3. Create a tool with `APIHubToolset`. Add the below to `tools.py`

    If your API requires authentication, you must configure authentication for
    the tool. The following code sample demonstrates how to configure an API
    key. ADK supports token based auth (API Key, Bearer token), service account,
    and OpenID Connect. We will soon add support for various OAuth2 flows.

    ```py
    from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.auth.auth_helpers import token_to_scheme_credential
    from google.adk.tools.apihub_tool.apihub_toolset import APIHubToolset

    # Provide authentication for your APIs. Not required if your APIs don't required authentication.
    auth_scheme, auth_credential = token_to_scheme_credential(
        "apikey", "query", "apikey", apikey_credential_str
    )

    sample_toolset = APIHubToolset(
        name="apihub-sample-tool",
        description="Sample Tool",
        access_token="...",  # Copy your access token generated in step 1
        apihub_resource_name="...", # API Hub resource name
        auth_scheme=auth_scheme,
        auth_credential=auth_credential,
    )
    ```

    For production deployment we recommend using a service account instead of an
    access token. In the code snippet above, use
    `service_account_json=service_account_cred_json_str` and provide your
    security account credentials instead of the token.

    For apihub\_resource\_name, if you know the specific ID of the OpenAPI Spec
    being used for your API, use
    `` `projects/my-project-id/locations/us-west1/apis/my-api-id/versions/version-id/specs/spec-id` ``.
    If you would like the Toolset to automatically pull the first available spec
    from the API, use
    `` `projects/my-project-id/locations/us-west1/apis/my-api-id` ``

4. Create your agent file Agent.py and add the created tools to your agent
   definition:

    ```py
    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
    from .tools import sample_toolset

    root_agent = LlmAgent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='enterprise_assistant',
        instruction='Help user, leverage the tools you have access to',
        tools=sample_toolset.get_tools(),
    )
    ```

5. Configure your `__init__.py` to expose your agent

    ```py
    from . import agent
    ```

6. Start the Google ADK Web UI and try your agent:

    ```shell
    # make sure to run `adk web` from your project_root_folder
    adk web
    ```

   Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to try your agent from the Web UI.

## Application Integration Tools

With **ApplicationIntegrationToolset**, you can seamlessly give your agents
secure and governed access to enterprise applications using Integration
Connectors' 100+ pre-built connectors for systems like Salesforce, ServiceNow,
JIRA, SAP, and more.

It supports both on-premise and SaaS applications. In addition, you can turn
your existing Application Integration process automations into agentic workflows
by providing application integration workflows as tools to your ADK agents.

Federated search within Application Integration lets you use ADK agents to query
multiple enterprise applications and data sources simultaneously.

[:fontawesome-brands-youtube:{.youtube-red-icon} See how ADK Federated Search in Application Integration works in this video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdlWOQe5RgU){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JdlWOQe5RgU?si=bFY_-jJ6Oliy5UMG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install ADK

Install Agent Development Kit following the steps in the
[installation guide](../get-started/installation.md).

#### 2. Install CLI

Install the
[Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#installation_instructions).
To use the tool with default credentials, run the following commands:

```shell
gcloud config set project <project-id>
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project-id>
```

Replace `<project-id>` with the unique ID of your Google Cloud project.

#### 3. Provision Application Integration workflow and publish Connection Tool

Use an existing
[Application Integration](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/overview)
workflow or
[Integrations Connector](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/overview)
connection you want to use with your agent. You can also create a new
[Application Integration workflow](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/setup-application-integration)
or a
[connection](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors/neo4j/configure#configure-the-connector).

Import and publish the
[Connection Tool](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations/templates/connection-tool/locations/global)
from the template library.

**Note**: To use a connector from Integration Connectors, you need to provision
the Application Integration in the same region as your connection.

#### 4. Create project structure

=== "Python"

    Set up your project structure and create the required files:

      ```console
      project_root_folder
      ├── .env
      └── my_agent
          ├── __init__.py
          ├── agent.py
          └── tools.py
      ```

    When running the agent, make sure to run `adk web` from the `project_root_folder`.

=== "Java"

    Set up your project structure and create the required files:

      ```console
        project_root_folder
        └── my_agent
            ├── agent.java
            └── pom.xml
      ```

     When running the agent, make sure to run the commands from the `project_root_folder`.

#### 5. Set roles and permissions

To get the permissions that you need to set up
**ApplicationIntegrationToolset**, you must have the following IAM roles on the
project (common to both Integration Connectors and Application Integration
Workflows):

    - roles/integrations.integrationEditor
    - roles/connectors.invoker
    - roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor

**Note:** When using Agent Engine (AE) for deployment, don't use
`roles/integrations.integrationInvoker`, as it can result in 403 errors. Use
`roles/integrations.integrationEditor` instead.

### Use Integration Connectors

Connect your agent to enterprise applications using
[Integration Connectors](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/overview).

#### Before you begin

**Note:** The *ExecuteConnection* integration is typically created automatically when you provision Application Integration in a given region. If the *ExecuteConnection* doesn't exist in the [list of integrations](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations/list), you must follow these steps to create it:

1. To use a connector from Integration Connectors, click **QUICK SETUP** and [provision](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations)
   Application Integration in the same region as your connection.

   ![Google Cloud Tools](../assets/application-integration-overview.png)



2. Go to the [Connection Tool](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations/templates/connection-tool/locations/us-central1)
   template in the template library and click **USE TEMPLATE**.


    ![Google Cloud Tools](../assets/use-connection-tool-template.png)

3. Enter the Integration Name as *ExecuteConnection* (it is mandatory to use this exact integration name only).
   Then, select the region to match your connection region and click **CREATE**.

4. Click **PUBLISH** to publish the integration in the <i>Application Integration</i> editor.


    ![Google Cloud Tools](../assets/publish-integration.png)


#### Create an Application Integration Toolset

To create an Application Integration Toolset for Integration Connectors, follow these steps:

1.  Create a tool with `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` in the `tools.py` file:

    ```py
    from google.adk.tools.application_integration_tool.application_integration_toolset import ApplicationIntegrationToolset

    connector_tool = ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
        project="test-project", # TODO: replace with GCP project of the connection
        location="us-central1", #TODO: replace with location of the connection
        connection="test-connection", #TODO: replace with connection name
        entity_operations={"Entity_One": ["LIST","CREATE"], "Entity_Two": []},#empty list for actions means all operations on the entity are supported.
        actions=["action1"], #TODO: replace with actions
        service_account_json='{...}', # optional. Stringified json for service account key
        tool_name_prefix="tool_prefix2",
        tool_instructions="..."
    )
    ```

    **Note:**

    * You can provide a service account to be used instead of default credentials by generating a [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating), and providing the right [Application Integration and Integration Connector IAM roles](#prerequisites) to the service account.
    * To find the list of supported entities and actions for a connection, use the Connectors APIs: [listActions](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.connections.connectionSchemaMetadata/listActions) or [listEntityTypes](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.connections.connectionSchemaMetadata/listEntityTypes).


    `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` supports `auth_scheme` and `auth_credential` for **dynamic OAuth2 authentication** for Integration Connectors. To use it, create a tool similar to this in the `tools.py` file:

    ```py
    from google.adk.tools.application_integration_tool.application_integration_toolset import ApplicationIntegrationToolset
    from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.auth.auth_helpers import dict_to_auth_scheme
    from google.adk.auth import AuthCredential
    from google.adk.auth import AuthCredentialTypes
    from google.adk.auth import OAuth2Auth

    oauth2_data_google_cloud = {
      "type": "oauth2",
      "flows": {
          "authorizationCode": {
              "authorizationUrl": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
              "tokenUrl": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
              "scopes": {
                  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform": (
                      "View and manage your data across Google Cloud Platform"
                      " services"
                  ),
                  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly": "View your calendars"
              },
          }
      },
    }

    oauth_scheme = dict_to_auth_scheme(oauth2_data_google_cloud)

    auth_credential = AuthCredential(
      auth_type=AuthCredentialTypes.OAUTH2,
      oauth2=OAuth2Auth(
          client_id="...", #TODO: replace with client_id
          client_secret="...", #TODO: replace with client_secret
      ),
    )

    connector_tool = ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
        project="test-project", # TODO: replace with GCP project of the connection
        location="us-central1", #TODO: replace with location of the connection
        connection="test-connection", #TODO: replace with connection name
        entity_operations={"Entity_One": ["LIST","CREATE"], "Entity_Two": []},#empty list for actions means all operations on the entity are supported.
        actions=["GET_calendars/%7BcalendarId%7D/events"], #TODO: replace with actions. this one is for list events
        service_account_json='{...}', # optional. Stringified json for service account key
        tool_name_prefix="tool_prefix2",
        tool_instructions="...",
        auth_scheme=oauth_scheme,
        auth_credential=auth_credential
    )
    ```


2. Update the `agent.py` file and add tool to your agent:

    ```py
    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
    from .tools import connector_tool

    root_agent = LlmAgent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='connector_agent',
        instruction="Help user, leverage the tools you have access to",
        tools=[connector_tool],
    )
    ```

3. Configure  `__init__.py` to expose your agent:

    ```py
    from . import agent
    ```

4. Start the Google ADK Web UI and use your agent:

    ```shell
    # make sure to run `adk web` from your project_root_folder
    adk web
    ```

After completing the above steps, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), and choose
   `my\_agent` agent (which is the same as the agent folder name).


### Use Application Integration Workflows

Use an existing
[Application Integration](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/overview)
workflow as a tool for your agent or create a new one.


#### 1. Create a tool

=== "Python"

    To create a tool with `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` in the `tools.py` file, use the following code:

      ```py
          integration_tool = ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
              project="test-project", # TODO: replace with GCP project of the connection
              location="us-central1", #TODO: replace with location of the connection
              integration="test-integration", #TODO: replace with integration name
              triggers=["api_trigger/test_trigger"],#TODO: replace with trigger id(s). Empty list would mean all api triggers in the integration to be considered.
              service_account_json='{...}', #optional. Stringified json for service account key
              tool_name_prefix="tool_prefix1",
              tool_instructions="..."
          )
      ```

      **Note:** You can provide a service account to be used instead of using default credentials. To do this, generate a [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) and provide the correct
         [Application Integration and Integration Connector IAM roles](#prerequisites) to the service account. For more details about the IAM roles, refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

=== "Java"

    To create a tool with `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` in the `tools.java` file, use the following code:

      ```java
          import com.google.adk.tools.applicationintegrationtoolset.ApplicationIntegrationToolset;
          import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
          import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap;

          public class Tools {
              private static ApplicationIntegrationToolset integrationTool;
              private static ApplicationIntegrationToolset connectionsTool;

              static {
                  integrationTool = new ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
                          "test-project",
                          "us-central1",
                          "test-integration",
                          ImmutableList.of("api_trigger/test-api"),
                          null,
                          null,
                          null,
                          "{...}",
                          "tool_prefix1",
                          "...");

                  connectionsTool = new ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
                          "test-project",
                          "us-central1",
                          null,
                          null,
                          "test-connection",
                          ImmutableMap.of("Issue", ImmutableList.of("GET")),
                          ImmutableList.of("ExecuteCustomQuery"),
                          "{...}",
                          "tool_prefix",
                          "...");
              }
          }
      ```

      **Note:** You can provide a service account to be used instead of using default credentials. To do this, generate a [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) and provide the correct [Application Integration and Integration Connector IAM roles](#prerequisites) to the service account. For more details about the IAM roles, refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

#### 2. Add the tool to your agent

=== "Python"

    To update the `agent.py` file and add the tool to your agent, use the following code:

      ```py
          from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
          from .tools import integration_tool, connector_tool

          root_agent = LlmAgent(
              model='gemini-2.0-flash',
              name='integration_agent',
              instruction="Help user, leverage the tools you have access to",
              tools=[integration_tool],
          )
      ```

=== "Java"

    To update the `agent.java` file and add the tool to your agent, use the following code:

      ```java
          import com.google.adk.agent.LlmAgent;
          import com.google.adk.tools.BaseTool;
          import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;

            public class MyAgent {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Assuming Tools class is defined as in the previous step
                    ImmutableList<BaseTool> tools = ImmutableList.<BaseTool>builder()
                            .add(Tools.integrationTool)
                            .add(Tools.connectionsTool)
                            .build();

                    // Finally, create your agent with the tools generated automatically.
                    LlmAgent rootAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
                            .name("science-teacher")
                            .description("Science teacher agent")
                            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
                            .instruction(
                                    "Help user, leverage the tools you have access to."
                            )
                            .tools(tools)
                            .build();

                    // You can now use rootAgent to interact with the LLM
                    // For example, you can start a conversation with the agent.
                }
            }
        ```

**Note:** To find the list of supported entities and actions for a
        connection, use these Connector APIs: `listActions`, `listEntityTypes`.

#### 3. Expose your agent

=== "Python"

    To configure `__init__.py` to expose your agent, use the following code:

      ```py
          from . import agent
      ```

#### 4. Use your agent

=== "Python"

    To start the Google ADK Web UI and use your agent, use the following commands:

      ```shell
          # make sure to run `adk web` from your project_root_folder
          adk web
      ```
    After completing the above steps, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), and choose the `my_agent` agent (which is the same as the agent folder name).

=== "Java"

    To start the Google ADK Web UI and use your agent, use the following commands:

      ```bash
          mvn install

          mvn exec:java \
              -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
              -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java" \
              -Dexec.classpathScope="compile"
      ```

    After completing the above steps, go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), and choose the `my_agent` agent (which is the same as the agent folder name).

# Model Context Protocol Tools

 This guide walks you through two ways of integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) with ADK.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to standardize how Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini and Claude communicate with external applications, data sources, and tools. Think of it as a universal connection mechanism that simplifies how LLMs obtain context, execute actions, and interact with various systems.

MCP follows a client-server architecture, defining how **data** (resources), **interactive templates** (prompts), and **actionable functions** (tools) are exposed by an **MCP server** and consumed by an **MCP client** (which could be an LLM host application or an AI agent).

This guide covers two primary integration patterns:

1. **Using Existing MCP Servers within ADK:** An ADK agent acts as an MCP client, leveraging tools provided by external MCP servers.
2. **Exposing ADK Tools via an MCP Server:** Building an MCP server that wraps ADK tools, making them accessible to any MCP client.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

* **Set up ADK:** Follow the standard ADK [setup instructions](../get-started/quickstart.md/#venv-install) in the quickstart.
* **Install/update Python/Java:** MCP requires Python version of 3.9 or higher for Python or Java 17 or higher.
* **Setup Node.js and npx:** **(Python only)** Many community MCP servers are distributed as Node.js packages and run using `npx`. Install Node.js (which includes npx) if you haven't already. For details, see [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).
* **Verify Installations:** **(Python only)** Confirm `adk` and `npx` are in your PATH within the activated virtual environment:

```shell
# Both commands should print the path to the executables.
which adk
which npx
```

## 1. Using MCP servers with ADK agents (ADK as an MCP client) in `adk web`

This section demonstrates how to integrate tools from external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers into your ADK agents. This is the **most common** integration pattern when your ADK agent needs to use capabilities provided by an existing service that exposes an MCP interface. You will see how the `MCPToolset` class can be directly added to your agent's `tools` list, enabling seamless connection to an MCP server, discovery of its tools, and making them available for your agent to use. These examples primarily focus on interactions within the `adk web` development environment.

### `MCPToolset` class

The `MCPToolset` class is ADK's primary mechanism for integrating tools from an MCP server. When you include an `MCPToolset` instance in your agent's `tools` list, it automatically handles the interaction with the specified MCP server. Here's how it works:

1.  **Connection Management:** On initialization, `MCPToolset` establishes and manages the connection to the MCP server. This can be a local server process (using `StdioConnectionParams` for communication over standard input/output) or a remote server (using `SseConnectionParams` for Server-Sent Events). The toolset also handles the graceful shutdown of this connection when the agent or application terminates.
2.  **Tool Discovery & Adaptation:** Once connected, `MCPToolset` queries the MCP server for its available tools (via the `list_tools` MCP method). It then converts the schemas of these discovered MCP tools into ADK-compatible `BaseTool` instances.
3.  **Exposure to Agent:** These adapted tools are then made available to your `LlmAgent` as if they were native ADK tools.
4.  **Proxying Tool Calls:** When your `LlmAgent` decides to use one of these tools, `MCPToolset` transparently proxies the call (using the `call_tool` MCP method) to the MCP server, sends the necessary arguments, and returns the server's response back to the agent.
5.  **Filtering (Optional):** You can use the `tool_filter` parameter when creating an `MCPToolset` to select a specific subset of tools from the MCP server, rather than exposing all of them to your agent.

The following examples demonstrate how to use `MCPToolset` within the `adk web` development environment. For scenarios where you need more fine-grained control over the MCP connection lifecycle or are not using `adk web`, refer to the "Using MCP Tools in your own Agent out of `adk web`" section later in this page.

### Example 1: File System MCP Server

This Python example demonstrates connecting to a local MCP server that provides file system operations.

#### Step 1: Define your Agent with `MCPToolset`

Create an `agent.py` file (e.g., in `./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/agent.py`). The `MCPToolset` is instantiated directly within the `tools` list of your `LlmAgent`.

*   **Important:** Replace `"/path/to/your/folder"` in the `args` list with the **absolute path** to an actual folder on your local system that the MCP server can access.
*   **Important:** Place the `.env` file in the parent directory of the `./adk_agent_samples` directory.

```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/agent.py
import os # Required for path operations
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

# It's good practice to define paths dynamically if possible,
# or ensure the user understands the need for an ABSOLUTE path.
# For this example, we'll construct a path relative to this file,
# assuming '/path/to/your/folder' is in the same directory as agent.py.
# REPLACE THIS with an actual absolute path if needed for your setup.
TARGET_FOLDER_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "/path/to/your/folder")
# Ensure TARGET_FOLDER_PATH is an absolute path for the MCP server.
# If you created ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/your_folder,

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='filesystem_assistant_agent',
    instruction='Help the user manage their files. You can list files, read files, etc.',
    tools=[
        MCPToolset(
            connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                server_params = StdioServerParameters(
                    command='npx',
                    args=[
                        "-y",  # Argument for npx to auto-confirm install
                        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                        # IMPORTANT: This MUST be an ABSOLUTE path to a folder the
                        # npx process can access.
                        # Replace with a valid absolute path on your system.
                        # For example: "/Users/youruser/accessible_mcp_files"
                        # or use a dynamically constructed absolute path:
                        os.path.abspath(TARGET_FOLDER_PATH),
                    ],
                ),
            ),
            # Optional: Filter which tools from the MCP server are exposed
            # tool_filter=['list_directory', 'read_file']
        )
    ],
)
```


#### Step 2: Create an `__init__.py` file

Ensure you have an `__init__.py` in the same directory as `agent.py` to make it a discoverable Python package for ADK.

```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/__init__.py
from . import agent
```

#### Step 3: Run `adk web` and Interact

Navigate to the parent directory of `mcp_agent` (e.g., `adk_agent_samples`) in your terminal and run:

```shell
cd ./adk_agent_samples # Or your equivalent parent directory
adk web
```

!!!info "Note for Windows users"

    When hitting the `_make_subprocess_transport NotImplementedError`, consider using `adk web --no-reload` instead.


Once the ADK Web UI loads in your browser:

1.  Select the `filesystem_assistant_agent` from the agent dropdown.
2.  Try prompts like:
    *   "List files in the current directory."
    *   "Can you read the file named sample.txt?" (assuming you created it in `TARGET_FOLDER_PATH`).
    *   "What is the content of `another_file.md`?"

You should see the agent interacting with the MCP file system server, and the server's responses (file listings, file content) relayed through the agent. The `adk web` console (terminal where you ran the command) might also show logs from the `npx` process if it outputs to stderr.

For Java, refer to the following sample to define an agent that initializes the `MCPToolset`:

```java
package agents;

     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Note: you may have permissions issues if the folder is outside home
        String yourFolderPath = "~/path/to/folder";

        ServerParameters connectionParams = ServerParameters.builder("npx")
                .args(List.of(
                        "-y",
                        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                        yourFolderPath
                ))
                .build();

        try {
            CompletableFuture<McpToolsAndToolsetResult> futureResult =
                    McpToolset.fromServer(connectionParams, JsonBaseModel.getMapper());

                        .description("An agent to help users access their file systems")
                        .instruction(
                                "Help user accessing their file systems. You can list files in a directory."

                        .tools(tools)
                        .build();

                System.out.println("Agent created: " + agent.name());

                InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(agent);
                String userId = "user123";
                String sessionId = "1234";
                String promptText = "Which files are in this directory - " + yourFolderPath + "?";

                // Explicitly create the session first
                try {
                    // appName for InMemoryRunner defaults to agent.name() if not specified in constructor
                    runner.sessionService().createSession(runner.appName(), userId, null, sessionId).blockingGet();
                    System.out.println("Session created: " + sessionId + " for user: " + userId);
                } catch (Exception sessionCreationException) {
                    System.err.println("Failed to create session: " + sessionCreationException.getMessage());
                    sessionCreationException.printStackTrace();
                    return;
                }

                Content promptContent = Content.fromParts(Part.fromText(promptText));

                System.out.println("\nSending prompt: \"" + promptText + "\" to agent...\n");

                runner.runAsync(userId, sessionId, promptContent, RunConfig.builder().build())
                        .blockingForEach(event -> {
                            System.out.println("Event received: " + event.toJson());
                        });
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {

            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Assuming a folder containing three files named `first`, `second` and `third`, successful response will look like this:

### Example 2: Google Maps MCP Server

This example demonstrates connecting to the Google Maps MCP server.

#### Step 1: Get API Key and Enable APIs

1.  **Google Maps API Key:** Follow the directions at [Use API keys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#create-api-keys) to obtain a Google Maps API Key.
2.  **Enable APIs:** In your Google Cloud project, ensure the following APIs are enabled:
    *   Directions API
    *   Routes API
    For instructions, see the [Getting started with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#enable-api-sdk) documentation.

#### Step 2: Define your Agent with `MCPToolset` for Google Maps

Modify your `agent.py` file (e.g., in `./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/agent.py`). Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with the actual API key you obtained.

```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/agent.py
import os
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

# Retrieve the API key from an environment variable or directly insert it.
# Using an environment variable is generally safer.
# Ensure this environment variable is set in the terminal where you run 'adk web'.
# Example: export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY"
google_maps_api_key = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")

if not google_maps_api_key:
    # Fallback or direct assignment for testing - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION
    google_maps_api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace if not using env var
    if google_maps_api_key == "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE":
        print("WARNING: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is not set. Please set it as an environment variable or in the script.")
        # You might want to raise an error or exit if the key is crucial and not found.

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='maps_assistant_agent',
    instruction='Help the user with mapping, directions, and finding places using Google Maps tools.',
    tools=[
        MCPToolset(
            connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                server_params = StdioServerParameters(
                    command='npx',
                    args=[
                        "-y",
                        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps",
                    ],
                    # Pass the API key as an environment variable to the npx process
                    # This is how the MCP server for Google Maps expects the key.
                    env={
                        "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": google_maps_api_key
                    }
                ),
            ),
            # You can filter for specific Maps tools if needed:
            # tool_filter=['get_directions', 'find_place_by_id']
        )
    ],
)
```

#### Step 3: Ensure `__init__.py` Exists

If you created this in Example 1, you can skip this. Otherwise, ensure you have an `__init__.py` in the `./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/` directory:

```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/__init__.py
from . import agent
```

#### Step 4: Run `adk web` and Interact

1.  **Set Environment Variable (Recommended):**
    Before running `adk web`, it's best to set your Google Maps API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your key.

2.  **Run `adk web`**:
    Navigate to the parent directory of `mcp_agent` (e.g., `adk_agent_samples`) and run:
    ```shell
    cd ./adk_agent_samples # Or your equivalent parent directory
    adk web
    ```

3.  **Interact in the UI**:
    *   Select the `maps_assistant_agent`.
    *   Try prompts like:
        *   "Get directions from GooglePlex to SFO."
        *   "Find coffee shops near Golden Gate Park."
        *   "What's the route from Paris, France to Berlin, Germany?"

You should see the agent use the Google Maps MCP tools to provide directions or location-based information.

```

## 2. Building an MCP server with ADK tools (MCP server exposing ADK)

This pattern allows you to wrap existing ADK tools and make them available to any standard MCP client application. The example in this section exposes the ADK `load_web_page` tool through a custom-built MCP server.

### Summary of steps

You will create a standard Python MCP server application using the `mcp` library. Within this server, you will:

1.  Instantiate the ADK tool(s) you want to expose (e.g., `FunctionTool(load_web_page)`).
2.  Implement the MCP server's `@app.list_tools()` handler to advertise the ADK tool(s). This involves converting the ADK tool definition to the MCP schema using the `adk_to_mcp_tool_type` utility from `google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.conversion_utils`.
3.  Implement the MCP server's `@app.call_tool()` handler. This handler will:
    *   Receive tool call requests from MCP clients.
    *   Identify if the request targets one of your wrapped ADK tools.
    *   Execute the ADK tool's `.run_async()` method.
    *   Format the ADK tool's result into an MCP-compliant response (e.g., `mcp.types.TextContent`).

### Prerequisites

Install the MCP server library in the same Python environment as your ADK installation:

```shell
pip install mcp
```

### Step 1: Create the MCP Server Script

Create a new Python file for your MCP server, for example, `my_adk_mcp_server.py`.

### Step 2: Implement the Server Logic

Add the following code to `my_adk_mcp_server.py`. This script sets up an MCP server that exposes the ADK `load_web_page` tool.

```python
# my_adk_mcp_server.py
import asyncio
import json
import os

### Step 3: Test your Custom MCP Server with an ADK Agent

Now, create an ADK agent that will act as a client to the MCP server you just built. This ADK agent will use `MCPToolset` to connect to your `my_adk_mcp_server.py` script.

Create an `agent.py` (e.g., in `./adk_agent_samples/mcp_client_agent/agent.py`):

```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_client_agent/agent.py
import os
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

# IMPORTANT: Replace this with the ABSOLUTE path to your my_adk_mcp_server.py script
PATH_TO_YOUR_MCP_SERVER_SCRIPT = "/path/to/your/my_adk_mcp_server.py" # <<< REPLACE

if PATH_TO_YOUR_MCP_SERVER_SCRIPT == "/path/to/your/my_adk_mcp_server.py":
    print("WARNING: PATH_TO_YOUR_MCP_SERVER_SCRIPT is not set. Please update it in agent.py.")
    # Optionally, raise an error if the path is critical

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='web_reader_mcp_client_agent',
    instruction="Use the 'load_web_page' tool to fetch content from a URL provided by the user.",
    tools=[
        MCPToolset(
            connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                server_params = StdioServerParameters(
                    command='python3', # Command to run your MCP server script
                    args=[PATH_TO_YOUR_MCP_SERVER_SCRIPT], # Argument is the path to the script
                )
            )
            # tool_filter=['load_web_page'] # Optional: ensure only specific tools are loaded
        )
    ],
)
```

And an `__init__.py` in the same directory:
```python
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_client_agent/__init__.py
from . import agent
```

**To run the test:**

1.  **Start your custom MCP server (optional, for separate observation):**
    You can run your `my_adk_mcp_server.py` directly in one terminal to see its logs:
    ```shell
    python3 /path/to/your/my_adk_mcp_server.py
    ```
    It will print "Launching MCP Server..." and wait. The ADK agent (run via `adk web`) will then connect to this process if the `command` in `StdioConnectionParams` is set up to execute it.
    *(Alternatively, `MCPToolset` will start this server script as a subprocess automatically when the agent initializes).*

2.  **Run `adk web` for the client agent:**
    Navigate to the parent directory of `mcp_client_agent` (e.g., `adk_agent_samples`) and run:
    ```shell
    cd ./adk_agent_samples # Or your equivalent parent directory
    adk web
    ```

3.  **Interact in the ADK Web UI:**
    *   Select the `web_reader_mcp_client_agent`.
    *   Try a prompt like: "Load the content from https://example.com"

The ADK agent (`web_reader_mcp_client_agent`) will use `MCPToolset` to start and connect to your `my_adk_mcp_server.py`. Your MCP server will receive the `call_tool` request, execute the ADK `load_web_page` tool, and return the result. The ADK agent will then relay this information. You should see logs from both the ADK Web UI (and its terminal) and potentially from your `my_adk_mcp_server.py` terminal if you ran it separately.

This example demonstrates how ADK tools can be encapsulated within an MCP server, making them accessible to a broader range of MCP-compliant clients, not just ADK agents.

Refer to the [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#core-mcp-concepts), to try it out with Claude Desktop.

## Using MCP Tools in your own Agent out of `adk web`

This section is relevant to you if:

* You are developing your own Agent using ADK
* And, you are **NOT** using `adk web`,
* And, you are exposing the agent via your own UI


Using MCP Tools requires a different setup than using regular tools, due to the fact that specs for MCP Tools are fetched asynchronously
from the MCP Server running remotely, or in another process.

The following example is modified from the "Example 1: File System MCP Server" example above. The main differences are:

1. Your tool and agent are created asynchronously
2. You need to properly manage the exit stack, so that your agents and tools are destructed properly when the connection to MCP Server is closed.

```python
# agent.py (modify get_tools_async and other parts as needed)
# ./adk_agent_samples/mcp_agent/agent.py
import os
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.artifacts.in_memory_artifact_service import InMemoryArtifactService # Optional
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

# Load environment variables from .env file in the parent directory
# Place this near the top, before using env vars like API keys
load_dotenv('../.env')

# Ensure TARGET_FOLDER_PATH is an absolute path for the MCP server.
TARGET_FOLDER_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "/path/to/your/folder")

# --- Step 1: Agent Definition ---
async def get_agent_async():
  """Creates an ADK Agent equipped with tools from the MCP Server."""
  toolset = MCPToolset(
      # Use StdioConnectionParams for local process communication
      connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
          server_params = StdioServerParameters(
            command='npx', # Command to run the server
            args=["-y",    # Arguments for the command
                "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                TARGET_FOLDER_PATH],
          ),
      ),
      tool_filter=['read_file', 'list_directory'] # Optional: filter specific tools
      # For remote servers, you would use SseConnectionParams instead:
      # connection_params=SseConnectionParams(url="http://remote-server:port/path", headers={...})
  )

  # Use in an agent
  root_agent = LlmAgent(
      model='gemini-2.0-flash', # Adjust model name if needed based on availability
      name='enterprise_assistant',
      instruction='Help user accessing their file systems',
      tools=[toolset], # Provide the MCP tools to the ADK agent
  )
  return root_agent, toolset

# --- Step 2: Main Execution Logic ---
async def async_main():
  session_service = InMemorySessionService()
  # Artifact service might not be needed for this example
  artifacts_service = InMemoryArtifactService()

  session = await session_service.create_session(
      state={}, app_name='mcp_filesystem_app', user_id='user_fs'
  )

  # TODO: Change the query to be relevant to YOUR specified folder.
  # e.g., "list files in the 'documents' subfolder" or "read the file 'notes.txt'"
  query = "list files in the tests folder"
  print(f"User Query: '{query}'")
  content = types.Content(role='user', parts=[types.Part(text=query)])

  root_agent, toolset = await get_agent_async()

  runner = Runner(
      app_name='mcp_filesystem_app',
      agent=root_agent,
      artifact_service=artifacts_service, # Optional
      session_service=session_service,
  )

  print("Running agent...")
  events_async = runner.run_async(
      session_id=session.id, user_id=session.user_id, new_message=content
  )

  async for event in events_async:
    print(f"Event received: {event}")

  # Cleanup is handled automatically by the agent framework
  # But you can also manually close if needed:
  print("Closing MCP server connection...")
  await toolset.close()
  print("Cleanup complete.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  try:
    asyncio.run(async_main())
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```


## Key considerations

When working with MCP and ADK, keep these points in mind:

* **Protocol vs. Library:** MCP is a protocol specification, defining communication rules. ADK is a Python library/framework for building agents. MCPToolset bridges these by implementing the client side of the MCP protocol within the ADK framework. Conversely, building an MCP server in Python requires using the model-context-protocol library.

* **ADK Tools vs. MCP Tools:**

    * ADK Tools (BaseTool, FunctionTool, AgentTool, etc.) are Python objects designed for direct use within the ADK's LlmAgent and Runner.
    * MCP Tools are capabilities exposed by an MCP Server according to the protocol's schema. MCPToolset makes these look like ADK tools to an LlmAgent.
    * Langchain/CrewAI Tools are specific implementations within those libraries, often simple functions or classes, lacking the server/protocol structure of MCP. ADK offers wrappers (LangchainTool, CrewaiTool) for some interoperability.

* **Asynchronous nature:** Both ADK and the MCP Python library are heavily based on the asyncio Python library. Tool implementations and server handlers should generally be async functions.

* **Stateful sessions (MCP):** MCP establishes stateful, persistent connections between a client and server instance. This differs from typical stateless REST APIs.

    * **Deployment:** This statefulness can pose challenges for scaling and deployment, especially for remote servers handling many users. The original MCP design often assumed client and server were co-located. Managing these persistent connections requires careful infrastructure considerations (e.g., load balancing, session affinity).
    * **ADK MCPToolset:** Manages this connection lifecycle. The exit\_stack pattern shown in the examples is crucial for ensuring the connection (and potentially the server process) is properly terminated when the ADK agent finishes.

## Deploying Agents with MCP Tools

When deploying ADK agents that use MCP tools to production environments like Cloud Run, GKE, or Vertex AI Agent Engine, you need to consider how MCP connections will work in containerized and distributed environments.

### Critical Deployment Requirement: Synchronous Agent Definition

**⚠️ Important:** When deploying agents with MCP tools, the agent and its MCPToolset must be defined **synchronously** in your `agent.py` file. While `adk web` allows for asynchronous agent creation, deployment environments require synchronous instantiation.

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Synchronous agent definition for deployment
import os
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import StdioConnectionParams
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

_allowed_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='enterprise_assistant',
    instruction=f'Help user accessing their file systems. Allowed directory: {_allowed_path}',
    tools=[
        MCPToolset(
            connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
                server_params=StdioServerParameters(
                    command='npx',
                    args=['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem', _allowed_path],
                ),
                timeout=5,  # Configure appropriate timeouts
            ),
            # Filter tools for security in production
            tool_filter=[
                'read_file', 'read_multiple_files', 'list_directory',
                'directory_tree', 'search_files', 'get_file_info',
                'list_allowed_directories',
            ],
        )
    ],
)
```

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Asynchronous patterns don't work in deployment
async def get_agent():  # This won't work for deployment
    toolset = await create_mcp_toolset_async()
    return LlmAgent(tools=[toolset])
```

### Quick Deployment Commands

#### Vertex AI Agent Engine
```bash
uv run adk deploy agent_engine \
  --project=<your-gcp-project-id> \
  --region=<your-gcp-region> \
  --staging_bucket="gs://<your-gcs-bucket>" \
  --display_name="My MCP Agent" \
  ./path/to/your/agent_directory
```

#### Cloud Run
```bash
uv run adk deploy cloud_run \
  --project=<your-gcp-project-id> \
  --region=<your-gcp-region> \
  --service_name=<your-service-name> \
  ./path/to/your/agent_directory
```

### Deployment Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Self-Contained Stdio MCP Servers

For MCP servers that can be packaged as npm packages or Python modules (like `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`), you can include them directly in your agent container:

**Container Requirements:**
```dockerfile
# Example for npm-based MCP servers
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Install Node.js and npm for MCP servers
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install your Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy your agent code
COPY . .

# Your agent can now use StdioConnectionParams with 'npx' commands
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

**Agent Configuration:**
```python
# This works in containers because npx and the MCP server run in the same environment
MCPToolset(
    connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
        server_params=StdioServerParameters(
            command='npx',
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/app/data"],
        ),
    ),
)
```

#### Pattern 2: Remote MCP Servers (Streamable HTTP)

For production deployments requiring scalability, deploy MCP servers as separate services and connect via Streamable HTTP:

**MCP Server Deployment (Cloud Run):**
```python
# deploy_mcp_server.py - Separate Cloud Run service using Streamable HTTP
import contextlib
import logging
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from typing import Any

import anyio
import click
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server.lowlevel import Server
from mcp.server.streamable_http_manager import StreamableHTTPSessionManager
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Mount
from starlette.types import Receive, Scope, Send

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def create_mcp_server():
    """Create and configure the MCP server."""
    app = Server("adk-mcp-streamable-server")

    @app.call_tool()
    async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict[str, Any]) -> list[types.ContentBlock]:
        """Handle tool calls from MCP clients."""
        # Example tool implementation - replace with your actual ADK tools
        if name == "example_tool":
            result = arguments.get("input", "No input provided")
            return [
                types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text=f"Processed: {result}"
                )
            ]
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown tool: {name}")

    @app.list_tools()
    async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
        """List available tools."""
        return [
            types.Tool(
                name="example_tool",
                description="Example tool for demonstration",
                inputSchema={
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "input": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "Input text to process"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["input"]
                }
            )
        ]

    return app

def main(port: int = 8080, json_response: bool = False):
    """Main server function."""
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    
    app = create_mcp_server()
    
    # Create session manager with stateless mode for scalability
    session_manager = StreamableHTTPSessionManager(
        app=app,
        event_store=None,
        json_response=json_response,
        stateless=True,  # Important for Cloud Run scalability
    )

    async def handle_streamable_http(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -> None:
        await session_manager.handle_request(scope, receive, send)

    @contextlib.asynccontextmanager
    async def lifespan(app: Starlette) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
        """Manage session manager lifecycle."""
        async with session_manager.run():
            logger.info("MCP Streamable HTTP server started!")
            try:
                yield
            finally:
                logger.info("MCP server shutting down...")

    # Create ASGI application
    starlette_app = Starlette(
        debug=False,  # Set to False for production
        routes=[
            Mount("/mcp", app=handle_streamable_http),
        ],
        lifespan=lifespan,
    )

    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(starlette_app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Agent Configuration for Remote MCP:**
```python
# Your ADK agent connects to the remote MCP service via Streamable HTTP
MCPToolset(
    connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(
        url="https://your-mcp-server-url.run.app/mcp",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-auth-token"}
    ),
)
```

#### Pattern 3: Sidecar MCP Servers (GKE)

In Kubernetes environments, you can deploy MCP servers as sidecar containers:

```yaml
# deployment.yaml - GKE with MCP sidecar
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: adk-agent-with-mcp
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      # Main ADK agent container
      - name: adk-agent
        image: your-adk-agent:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: MCP_SERVER_URL
          value: "http://localhost:8081"
      
      # MCP server sidecar
      - name: mcp-server
        image: your-mcp-server:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
```

### Connection Management Considerations

#### Stdio Connections
- **Pros:** Simple setup, process isolation, works well in containers
- **Cons:** Process overhead, not suitable for high-scale deployments
- **Best for:** Development, single-tenant deployments, simple MCP servers

#### SSE/HTTP Connections  
- **Pros:** Network-based, scalable, can handle multiple clients
- **Cons:** Requires network infrastructure, authentication complexity
- **Best for:** Production deployments, multi-tenant systems, external MCP services

### Production Deployment Checklist

When deploying agents with MCP tools to production:

**✅ Connection Lifecycle**
- Ensure proper cleanup of MCP connections using exit_stack patterns
- Configure appropriate timeouts for connection establishment and requests
- Implement retry logic for transient connection failures

**✅ Resource Management**
- Monitor memory usage for stdio MCP servers (each spawns a process)
- Configure appropriate CPU/memory limits for MCP server processes
- Consider connection pooling for remote MCP servers

**✅ Security**
- Use authentication headers for remote MCP connections
- Restrict network access between ADK agents and MCP servers
- **Filter MCP tools using `tool_filter` to limit exposed functionality**
- Validate MCP tool inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use restrictive file paths for filesystem MCP servers (e.g., `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))`)
- Consider read-only tool filters for production environments

**✅ Monitoring & Observability**
- Log MCP connection establishment and teardown events
- Monitor MCP tool execution times and success rates
- Set up alerts for MCP connection failures

**✅ Scalability**
- For high-volume deployments, prefer remote MCP servers over stdio
- Configure session affinity if using stateful MCP servers
- Consider MCP server connection limits and implement circuit breakers

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Cloud Run
```python
# Cloud Run environment variables for MCP configuration
import os

# Detect Cloud Run environment
if os.getenv('K_SERVICE'):
    # Use remote MCP servers in Cloud Run
    mcp_connection = SseConnectionParams(
        url=os.getenv('MCP_SERVER_URL'),
        headers={'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.getenv('MCP_AUTH_TOKEN')}"}
    )
else:
    # Use stdio for local development
    mcp_connection = StdioConnectionParams(
        server_params=StdioServerParameters(
            command='npx',
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
        )
    )

MCPToolset(connection_params=mcp_connection)
```

#### GKE
```python
# GKE-specific MCP configuration
# Use service discovery for MCP servers within the cluster
MCPToolset(
    connection_params=SseConnectionParams(
        url="http://mcp-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/sse"
    ),
)
```

#### Vertex AI Agent Engine
```python
# Agent Engine managed deployment
# Prefer lightweight, self-contained MCP servers or external services
MCPToolset(
    connection_params=SseConnectionParams(
        url="https://your-managed-mcp-service.googleapis.com/sse",
        headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)'}
    ),
)
```

### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

**Common MCP Deployment Problems:**

1. **Stdio Process Startup Failures**
   ```python
   # Debug stdio connection issues
   MCPToolset(
       connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
           server_params=StdioServerParameters(
               command='npx',
               args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/app/data"],
               # Add environment debugging
               env={'DEBUG': '1'}
           ),
       ),
   )
   ```

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   ```python
   # Test remote MCP connectivity
   import aiohttp
   
   async def test_mcp_connection():
       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           async with session.get('https://your-mcp-server.com/health') as resp:
               print(f"MCP Server Health: {resp.status}")
   ```

3. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Monitor container memory usage when using stdio MCP servers
   - Set appropriate limits in Kubernetes deployments
   - Use remote MCP servers for resource-intensive operations

# Increase tool performance with parallel execution

Starting with Agent Development Kit (ADK) version 1.10.0, the framework
attempts to run any agent-requested 
[function tools](/adk-docs/tools/function-tools/) 
in parallel. This behavior can significantly improve the performance and
responsiveness of your agents, particularly for agents that rely on multiple
external APIs or long-running tasks. For example, if you have 3 tools that each
take 2 seconds, by running them in parallel, the total execution time will be
closer to 2 seconds, instead of 6 seconds. The ability to run tool functions
parallel can improve the performance of your agents, particularly in the
following scenarios:

-   **Research tasks:** Where the agent collects information from multiple
    sources before proceeding to the next stage of the workflow.
-   **API calls:** Where the agent accesses several APIs independently, such
    as searching for available flights using APIs from multiple airlines.
-   **Publishing and communication tasks:** When the agent needs to publish
    or communicate through multiple, independent channels or multiple recipients.

However, your custom tools must be built with asynchronous execution support to
enable this performance improvement. This guide explains how parallel tool
execution works in the ADK and how to build your tools to take full advantage of
this processing feature.

!!! warning
    Any ADK Tools that use synchronous processing in a set of tool function
    calls will block other tools from executing in parallel, even if the other
    tools allow for parallel execution.

## Build parallel-ready tools

Enable parallel execution of your tool functions by defining them as
asynchronous functions. In Python code, this means using `async def` and `await`
syntax which allows the ADK to run them concurrently in an `asyncio` event loop.
The following sections show examples of agent tools built for parallel
processing and asynchronous operations.

### Example of http web call

The following code example show how to modify the `get_weather()` function to
operate asynchronously and allow for parallel execution:

```python
 async def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
      async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
          async with session.get(f"http://api.weather.com/{city}") as response:
              return await response.json()
```

### Example of database call

The following code example show how to write a database calling function to
operate asynchronously:

```python
async def query_database(query: str) -> list:
      async with asyncpg.connect("postgresql://...") as conn:
          return await conn.fetch(query)
```

### Example of yielding behavior for long loops

In cases where a tool is processing multiple requests or numerous long running
requests, consider adding yielding code to allow other tools to execute, as
shown in the following code sample:

```python
async def process_data(data: list) -> dict:
      results = []
      for i, item in enumerate(data):
          processed = await process_item(item)  # Yield point
          results.append(processed)

          # Add periodic yield points for long loops
          if i % 100 == 0:
              await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield control
      return {"results": results}
```

!!! tip "Important"
    Use the `asyncio.sleep()` function for pauses to avoid blocking
    execution of other functions.

### Example of thread pools for intensive operations

When performing processing-intensive functions, consider creating thread pools
for better management of available computing resources, as shown in the
following example:

```python
async def cpu_intensive_tool(data: list) -> dict:
      loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

      # Use thread pool for CPU-bound work
      with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
          result = await loop.run_in_executor(
              executor,
              expensive_computation,
              data
          )
      return {"result": result}
```

### Example of process chunking

When performing processes on long lists or large amounts of data, consider
combining a thread pool technique with dividing up processing into chunks of
data, and yielding processing time between the chunks, as shown in the following
example:

```python
 async def process_large_dataset(dataset: list) -> dict:
      results = []
      chunk_size = 1000

      for i in range(0, len(dataset), chunk_size):
          chunk = dataset[i:i + chunk_size]

          # Process chunk in thread pool
          loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
          with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
              chunk_result = await loop.run_in_executor(
                  executor, process_chunk, chunk
              )

          results.extend(chunk_result)

          # Yield control between chunks
          await asyncio.sleep(0)

      return {"total_processed": len(results), "results": results}
```

## Write parallel-ready prompts and tool descriptions

When building prompts for AI models, consider explicitly specifying or hinting
that function calls be made in parallel. The following example of an AI prompt
directs the model to use tools in parallel:

```none
When users ask for multiple pieces of information, always call functions in
parallel.

  Examples:
  - "Get weather for London and currency rate USD to EUR" → Call both functions
    simultaneously
  - "Compare cities A and B" → Call get_weather, get_population, get_distance in 
    parallel
  - "Analyze multiple stocks" → Call get_stock_price for each stock in parallel

  Always prefer multiple specific function calls over single complex calls.
```

The following example shows a tool function description that hints at more
efficient use through parallel execution:

```python
 async def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
      """Get current weather for a single city.

      This function is optimized for parallel execution - call multiple times for different cities.

      Args:
          city: Name of the city, for example: 'London', 'New York'

      Returns:
          Weather data including temperature, conditions, humidity
      """
      await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate API call
      return {"city": city, "temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"}
```

# Custom Tools for ADK

In an ADK agent workflow, Tools are programming functions with structured input
and output that can be called by an ADK Agent to perform actions. ADK Tools
function similarly to how you use a 
[Function Call](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling) 
with Gemini or other generative AI models. You can perform various actions and
programming functions with an ADK Tool, such as:

*   Querying databases
*   Making API requests: getting weather data, booking systems
*   Searching the web
*   Executing code snippets
*   Retrieving information from documents (RAG)
*   Interacting with other software or services

!!! tip "[ADK Tools list](/adk-docs/tools/)"
    Before building your own Tools for ADK, check out the 
    **[ADK Tools list](/adk-docs/tools/)**
    for pre-built tools you can use with ADK Agents.

## What is a Tool?

In the context of ADK, a Tool represents a specific
capability provided to an AI agent, enabling it to perform actions and interact
with the world beyond its core text generation and reasoning abilities. What
distinguishes capable agents from basic language models is often their effective
use of tools.

Technically, a tool is typically a modular code component—**like a Python/ Java
function**, a class method, or even another specialized agent—designed to
execute a distinct, predefined task. These tasks often involve interacting with
external systems or data.

<img src="../assets/agent-tool-call.png" alt="Agent tool call">

### Key Characteristics

**Action-Oriented:** Tools perform specific actions for an agent, such as 
searching for information, calling an API, or performing calculations.

**Extends Agent capabilities:** They empower agents to access real-time information, affect external systems, and overcome the knowledge limitations inherent in their training data.

**Execute predefined logic:** Crucially, tools execute specific, developer-defined logic. They do not possess their own independent reasoning capabilities like the agent's core Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM reasons about which tool to use, when, and with what inputs, but the tool itself just executes its designated function.

## How Agents Use Tools

Agents leverage tools dynamically through mechanisms often involving function calling. The process generally follows these steps:

1. **Reasoning:** The agent's LLM analyzes its system instruction, conversation history, and user request.
2. **Selection:** Based on the analysis, the LLM decides on which tool, if any, to execute, based on the tools available to the agent and the docstrings that describes each tool.
3. **Invocation:** The LLM generates the required arguments (inputs) for the selected tool and triggers its execution.
4. **Observation:** The agent receives the output (result) returned by the tool.
5. **Finalization:** The agent incorporates the tool's output into its ongoing reasoning process to formulate the next response, decide the subsequent step, or determine if the goal has been achieved.

Think of the tools as a specialized toolkit that the agent's intelligent core (the LLM) can access and utilize as needed to accomplish complex tasks.

## Tool Types in ADK

ADK offers flexibility by supporting several types of tools:

1. **[Function Tools](../tools/function-tools.md):** Tools created by you, tailored to your specific application's needs.
    * **[Functions/Methods](../tools/function-tools.md#1-function-tool):** Define standard synchronous functions or methods in your code (e.g., Python def).
    * **[Agents-as-Tools](../tools/function-tools.md#3-agent-as-a-tool):** Use another, potentially specialized, agent as a tool for a parent agent.
    * **[Long Running Function Tools](../tools/function-tools.md#2-long-running-function-tool):** Support for tools that perform asynchronous operations or take significant time to complete.
2. **[Built-in Tools](../tools/built-in-tools.md):** Ready-to-use tools provided by the framework for common tasks.
        Examples: Google Search, Code Execution, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
3. **[Third-Party Tools](/adk-docs/tools/third-party/):** Integrate tools seamlessly from popular external libraries.
        Examples: LangChain Tools, CrewAI Tools.

Navigate to the respective documentation pages linked above for detailed information and examples for each tool type.

## Referencing Tool in Agent’s Instructions

Within an agent's instructions, you can directly reference a tool by using its **function name.** If the tool's **function name** and **docstring** are sufficiently descriptive, your instructions can primarily focus on **when the Large Language Model (LLM) should utilize the tool**. This promotes clarity and helps the model understand the intended use of each tool.

It is **crucial to clearly instruct the agent on how to handle different return values** that a tool might produce. For example, if a tool returns an error message, your instructions should specify whether the agent should retry the operation, give up on the task, or request additional information from the user.

Furthermore, ADK supports the sequential use of tools, where the output of one tool can serve as the input for another. When implementing such workflows, it's important to **describe the intended sequence of tool usage** within the agent's instructions to guide the model through the necessary steps.

### Example

The following example showcases how an agent can use tools by **referencing their function names in its instructions**. It also demonstrates how to guide the agent to **handle different return values from tools**, such as success or error messages, and how to orchestrate the **sequential use of multiple tools** to accomplish a task.

    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/WeatherSentimentAgentApp.java:full_code"
    ```

## Tool Context

For more advanced scenarios, ADK allows you to access additional contextual information within your tool function by including the special parameter `tool_context: ToolContext`. By including this in the function signature, ADK will **automatically** provide an **instance of the ToolContext** class when your tool is called during agent execution.

The **ToolContext** provides access to several key pieces of information and control levers:

* `state: State`: Read and modify the current session's state. Changes made here are tracked and persisted.

* `actions: EventActions`: Influence the agent's subsequent actions after the tool runs (e.g., skip summarization, transfer to another agent).

* `function_call_id: str`: The unique identifier assigned by the framework to this specific invocation of the tool. Useful for tracking and correlating with authentication responses. This can also be helpful when multiple tools are called within a single model response.

* `function_call_event_id: str`: This attribute provides the unique identifier of the **event** that triggered the current tool call. This can be useful for tracking and logging purposes.

* `auth_response: Any`: Contains the authentication response/credentials if an authentication flow was completed before this tool call.

* Access to Services: Methods to interact with configured services like Artifacts and Memory.

Note that you shouldn't include the `tool_context` parameter in the tool function docstring. Since `ToolContext` is automatically injected by the ADK framework *after* the LLM decides to call the tool function, it is not relevant for the LLM's decision-making and including it can confuse the LLM.

### **State Management**

The `tool_context.state` attribute provides direct read and write access to the state associated with the current session. It behaves like a dictionary but ensures that any modifications are tracked as deltas and persisted by the session service. This enables tools to maintain and share information across different interactions and agent steps.

* **Reading State**: Use standard dictionary access (`tool_context.state['my_key']`) or the `.get()` method (`tool_context.state.get('my_key', default_value)`).

* **Writing State**: Assign values directly (`tool_context.state['new_key'] = 'new_value'`). These changes are recorded in the state_delta of the resulting event.

* **State Prefixes**: Remember the standard state prefixes:

    * `app:*`: Shared across all users of the application.

    * `user:*`: Specific to the current user across all their sessions.

    * (No prefix): Specific to the current session.

    * `temp:*`: Temporary, not persisted across invocations (useful for passing data within a single run call but generally less useful inside a tool context which operates between LLM calls).

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/overview/user_preference.py"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.tools.FunctionTool;
    import com.google.adk.tools.ToolContext;

    // Updates a user-specific preference.
    public Map<String, String> updateUserThemePreference(String value, ToolContext toolContext) {
      String userPrefsKey = "user:preferences:theme";
  
      // Get current preferences or initialize if none exist
      String preference = toolContext.state().getOrDefault(userPrefsKey, "").toString();
      if (preference.isEmpty()) {
        preference = value;
      }
  
      // Write the updated dictionary back to the state
      toolContext.state().put("user:preferences", preference);
      System.out.printf("Tool: Updated user preference %s to %s", userPrefsKey, preference);
  
      return Map.of("status", "success", "updated_preference", toolContext.state().get(userPrefsKey).toString());
      // When the LLM calls updateUserThemePreference("dark"):
      // The toolContext.state will be updated, and the change will be part of the
      // resulting tool response event's actions.stateDelta.
    }
    ```

### **Controlling Agent Flow**

The `tool_context.actions` attribute (`ToolContext.actions()` in Java) holds an **EventActions** object. Modifying attributes on this object allows your tool to influence what the agent or framework does after the tool finishes execution.

* **`skip_summarization: bool`**: (Default: False) If set to True, instructs the ADK to bypass the LLM call that typically summarizes the tool's output. This is useful if your tool's return value is already a user-ready message.

* **`transfer_to_agent: str`**: Set this to the name of another agent. The framework will halt the current agent's execution and **transfer control of the conversation to the specified agent**. This allows tools to dynamically hand off tasks to more specialized agents.

* **`escalate: bool`**: (Default: False) Setting this to True signals that the current agent cannot handle the request and should pass control up to its parent agent (if in a hierarchy). In a LoopAgent, setting **escalate=True** in a sub-agent's tool will terminate the loop.

#### Example

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/overview/customer_support_agent.py"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/tools/CustomerSupportAgentApp.java:full_code"
    ```

##### Explanation

* We define two agents: `main_agent` and `support_agent`. The `main_agent` is designed to be the initial point of contact.
* The `check_and_transfer` tool, when called by `main_agent`, examines the user's query.
* If the query contains the word "urgent", the tool accesses the `tool_context`, specifically **`tool_context.actions`**, and sets the transfer\_to\_agent attribute to `support_agent`.
* This action signals to the framework to **transfer the control of the conversation to the agent named `support_agent`**.
* When the `main_agent` processes the urgent query, the `check_and_transfer` tool triggers the transfer. The subsequent response would ideally come from the `support_agent`.
* For a normal query without urgency, the tool simply processes it without triggering a transfer.

This example illustrates how a tool, through EventActions in its ToolContext, can dynamically influence the flow of the conversation by transferring control to another specialized agent.

### **Authentication**

![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

ToolContext provides mechanisms for tools interacting with authenticated APIs. If your tool needs to handle authentication, you might use the following:

* **`auth_response`**: Contains credentials (e.g., a token) if authentication was already handled by the framework before your tool was called (common with RestApiTool and OpenAPI security schemes).

* **`request_credential(auth_config: dict)`**: Call this method if your tool determines authentication is needed but credentials aren't available. This signals the framework to start an authentication flow based on the provided auth_config.

* **`get_auth_response()`**: Call this in a subsequent invocation (after request_credential was successfully handled) to retrieve the credentials the user provided.

For detailed explanations of authentication flows, configuration, and examples, please refer to the dedicated Tool Authentication documentation page.

### **Context-Aware Data Access Methods**

These methods provide convenient ways for your tool to interact with persistent data associated with the session or user, managed by configured services.

* **`list_artifacts()`** (or **`listArtifacts()`** in Java): Returns a list of filenames (or keys) for all artifacts currently stored for the session via the artifact_service. Artifacts are typically files (images, documents, etc.) uploaded by the user or generated by tools/agents.

* **`load_artifact(filename: str)`**: Retrieves a specific artifact by its filename from the **artifact_service**. You can optionally specify a version; if omitted, the latest version is returned. Returns a `google.genai.types.Part` object containing the artifact data and mime type, or None if not found.

* **`save_artifact(filename: str, artifact: types.Part)`**: Saves a new version of an artifact to the artifact_service. Returns the new version number (starting from 0).

* **`search_memory(query: str)`** ![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/ coming soon."}

       Queries the user's long-term memory using the configured `memory_service`. This is useful for retrieving relevant information from past interactions or stored knowledge. The structure of the **SearchMemoryResponse** depends on the specific memory service implementation but typically contains relevant text snippets or conversation excerpts.

#### Example

=== "Python"

    ```py
    --8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/overview/doc_analysis.py"
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // Analyzes a document using context from memory.
    // You can also list, load and save artifacts using Callback Context or LoadArtifacts tool.
    public static @NonNull Maybe<ImmutableMap<String, Object>> processDocument(
        @Annotations.Schema(description = "The name of the document to analyze.") String documentName,
        @Annotations.Schema(description = "The query for the analysis.") String analysisQuery,
        ToolContext toolContext) {
  
      // 1. List all available artifacts
      System.out.printf(
          "Listing all available artifacts %s:", toolContext.listArtifacts().blockingGet());
  
      // 2. Load an artifact to memory
      System.out.println("Tool: Attempting to load artifact: " + documentName);
      Part documentPart = toolContext.loadArtifact(documentName, Optional.empty()).blockingGet();
      if (documentPart == null) {
        System.out.println("Tool: Document '" + documentName + "' not found.");
        return Maybe.just(
            ImmutableMap.<String, Object>of(
                "status", "error", "message", "Document '" + documentName + "' not found."));
      }
      String documentText = documentPart.text().orElse("");
      System.out.println(
          "Tool: Loaded document '" + documentName + "' (" + documentText.length() + " chars).");
  
      // 3. Perform analysis (placeholder)
      String analysisResult =
          "Analysis of '"
              + documentName
              + "' regarding '"
              + analysisQuery
              + " [Placeholder Analysis Result]";
      System.out.println("Tool: Performed analysis.");
  
      // 4. Save the analysis result as a new artifact
      Part analysisPart = Part.fromText(analysisResult);
      String newArtifactName = "analysis_" + documentName;
  
      toolContext.saveArtifact(newArtifactName, analysisPart);
  
      return Maybe.just(
          ImmutableMap.<String, Object>builder()
              .put("status", "success")
              .put("analysis_artifact", newArtifactName)
              .build());
    }
    // FunctionTool processDocumentTool =
    //      FunctionTool.create(ToolContextArtifactExample.class, "processDocument");
    // In the Agent, include this function tool.
    // LlmAgent agent = LlmAgent().builder().tools(processDocumentTool).build();
    ```

By leveraging the **ToolContext**, developers can create more sophisticated and context-aware custom tools that seamlessly integrate with ADK's architecture and enhance the overall capabilities of their agents.

## Defining Effective Tool Functions

When using a method or function as an ADK Tool, how you define it significantly impacts the agent's ability to use it correctly. The agent's Large Language Model (LLM) relies heavily on the function's **name**, **parameters (arguments)**, **type hints**, and **docstring** / **source code comments** to understand its purpose and generate the correct call.

Here are key guidelines for defining effective tool functions:

* **Function Name:**
    * Use descriptive, verb-noun based names that clearly indicate the action (e.g., `get_weather`, `searchDocuments`, `schedule_meeting`).
    * Avoid generic names like `run`, `process`, `handle_data`, or overly ambiguous names like `doStuff`. Even with a good description, a name like `do_stuff` might confuse the model about when to use the tool versus, for example, `cancelFlight`.
    * The LLM uses the function name as a primary identifier during tool selection.

* **Parameters (Arguments):**
    * Your function can have any number of parameters.
    * Use clear and descriptive names (e.g., `city` instead of `c`, `search_query` instead of `q`).
    * **Provide type hints in Python**  for all parameters (e.g., `city: str`, `user_id: int`, `items: list[str]`). This is essential for ADK to generate the correct schema for the LLM.
    * Ensure all parameter types are **JSON serializable**. All java primitives as well as standard Python types like `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, and their combinations are generally safe. Avoid complex custom class instances as direct parameters unless they have a clear JSON representation.
    * **Do not set default values** for parameters. E.g., `def my_func(param1: str = "default")`. Default values are not reliably supported or used by the underlying models during function call generation. All necessary information should be derived by the LLM from the context or explicitly requested if missing.
    * **`self` / `cls` Handled Automatically:** Implicit parameters like `self` (for instance methods) or `cls` (for class methods) are automatically handled by ADK and excluded from the schema shown to the LLM. You only need to define type hints and descriptions for the logical parameters your tool requires the LLM to provide.

* **Return Type:**
    * The function's return value **must be a dictionary (`dict`)** in Python or a **Map** in Java.
    * If your function returns a non-dictionary type (e.g., a string, number, list), the ADK framework will automatically wrap it into a dictionary/Map like `{'result': your_original_return_value}` before passing the result back to the model.
    * Design the dictionary/Map keys and values to be **descriptive and easily understood *by the LLM***. Remember, the model reads this output to decide its next step.
    * Include meaningful keys. For example, instead of returning just an error code like `500`, return `{'status': 'error', 'error_message': 'Database connection failed'}`.
    * It's a **highly recommended practice** to include a `status` key (e.g., `'success'`, `'error'`, `'pending'`, `'ambiguous'`) to clearly indicate the outcome of the tool execution for the model.

* **Docstring / Source Code Comments:**
    * **This is critical.** The docstring is the primary source of descriptive information for the LLM.
    * **Clearly state what the tool *does*.** Be specific about its purpose and limitations.
    * **Explain *when* the tool should be used.** Provide context or example scenarios to guide the LLM's decision-making.
    * **Describe *each parameter* clearly.** Explain what information the LLM needs to provide for that argument.
    * Describe the **structure and meaning of the expected `dict` return value**, especially the different `status` values and associated data keys.
    * **Do not describe the injected ToolContext parameter**. Avoid mentioning the optional `tool_context: ToolContext` parameter within the docstring description since it is not a parameter the LLM needs to know about. ToolContext is injected by ADK, *after* the LLM decides to call it. 

    **Example of a good definition:**

=== "Python"
    
    ```python
    def lookup_order_status(order_id: str) -> dict:
      """Fetches the current status of a customer's order using its ID.

      Use this tool ONLY when a user explicitly asks for the status of
      a specific order and provides the order ID. Do not use it for
      general inquiries.

      Args:
          order_id: The unique identifier of the order to look up.

      Returns:
          A dictionary indicating the outcome.
          On success, status is 'success' and includes an 'order' dictionary.
          On failure, status is 'error' and includes an 'error_message'.
          Example success: {'status': 'success', 'order': {'state': 'shipped', 'tracking_number': '1Z9...'}}
          Example error: {'status': 'error', 'error_message': 'Order ID not found.'}
      """
      # ... function implementation to fetch status ...
      if status_details := fetch_status_from_backend(order_id):
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "order": {
                "state": status_details.state,
                "tracking_number": status_details.tracking,
            },
        }
      else:
        return {"status": "error", "error_message": f"Order ID {order_id} not found."}

    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    /**
     * Retrieves the current weather report for a specified city.
     *
     * @param city The city for which to retrieve the weather report.
     * @param toolContext The context for the tool.
     * @return A dictionary containing the weather information.
     */
    public static Map<String, Object> getWeatherReport(String city, ToolContext toolContext) {
        Map<String, Object> response = new HashMap<>();
        if (city.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).equals("london")) {
            response.put("status", "success");
            response.put(
                    "report",
                    "The current weather in London is cloudy with a temperature of 18 degrees Celsius and a"
                            + " chance of rain.");
        } else if (city.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).equals("paris")) {
            response.put("status", "success");
            response.put("report", "The weather in Paris is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.");
        } else {
            response.put("status", "error");
            response.put("error_message", String.format("Weather information for '%s' is not available.", city));
        }
        return response;
    }
    ```

* **Simplicity and Focus:**
    * **Keep Tools Focused:** Each tool should ideally perform one well-defined task.
    * **Fewer Parameters are Better:** Models generally handle tools with fewer, clearly defined parameters more reliably than those with many optional or complex ones.
    * **Use Simple Data Types:** Prefer basic types (`str`, `int`, `bool`, `float`, `List[str]`, in **Python**, or `int`, `byte`, `short`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean` and `char` in **Java**) over complex custom classes or deeply nested structures as parameters when possible.
    * **Decompose Complex Tasks:** Break down functions that perform multiple distinct logical steps into smaller, more focused tools. For instance, instead of a single `update_user_profile(profile: ProfileObject)` tool, consider separate tools like `update_user_name(name: str)`, `update_user_address(address: str)`, `update_user_preferences(preferences: list[str])`, etc. This makes it easier for the LLM to select and use the correct capability.

By adhering to these guidelines, you provide the LLM with the clarity and structure it needs to effectively utilize your custom function tools, leading to more capable and reliable agent behavior.

## Toolsets: Grouping and Dynamically Providing Tools ![python_only](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently_supported_in-Python-blue){ title="This feature is currently available for Python. Java support is planned/coming soon."}

Beyond individual tools, ADK introduces the concept of a **Toolset** via the `BaseToolset` interface (defined in `google.adk.tools.base_toolset`). A toolset allows you to manage and provide a collection of `BaseTool` instances, often dynamically, to an agent.

This approach is beneficial for:

*   **Organizing Related Tools:** Grouping tools that serve a common purpose (e.g., all tools for mathematical operations, or all tools interacting with a specific API).
*   **Dynamic Tool Availability:** Enabling an agent to have different tools available based on the current context (e.g., user permissions, session state, or other runtime conditions). The `get_tools` method of a toolset can decide which tools to expose.
*   **Integrating External Tool Providers:** Toolsets can act as adapters for tools coming from external systems, like an OpenAPI specification or an MCP server, converting them into ADK-compatible `BaseTool` objects.

### The `BaseToolset` Interface

Any class acting as a toolset in ADK should implement the `BaseToolset` abstract base class. This interface primarily defines two methods:

*   **`async def get_tools(...) -> list[BaseTool]:`**
    This is the core method of a toolset. When an ADK agent needs to know its available tools, it will call `get_tools()` on each `BaseToolset` instance provided in its `tools` list.
    *   It receives an optional `readonly_context` (an instance of `ReadonlyContext`). This context provides read-only access to information like the current session state (`readonly_context.state`), agent name, and invocation ID. The toolset can use this context to dynamically decide which tools to return.
    *   It **must** return a `list` of `BaseTool` instances (e.g., `FunctionTool`, `RestApiTool`).

*   **`async def close(self) -> None:`**
    This asynchronous method is called by the ADK framework when the toolset is no longer needed, for example, when an agent server is shutting down or the `Runner` is being closed. Implement this method to perform any necessary cleanup, such as closing network connections, releasing file handles, or cleaning up other resources managed by the toolset.

### Using Toolsets with Agents

You can include instances of your `BaseToolset` implementations directly in an `LlmAgent`'s `tools` list, alongside individual `BaseTool` instances.

When the agent initializes or needs to determine its available capabilities, the ADK framework will iterate through the `tools` list:

*   If an item is a `BaseTool` instance, it's used directly.
*   If an item is a `BaseToolset` instance, its `get_tools()` method is called (with the current `ReadonlyContext`), and the returned list of `BaseTool`s is added to the agent's available tools.

### Example: A Simple Math Toolset

Let's create a basic example of a toolset that provides simple arithmetic operations.

```py
--8<-- "examples/python/snippets/tools/overview/toolset_example.py:init"
```

In this example:

*   `SimpleMathToolset` implements `BaseToolset` and its `get_tools()` method returns `FunctionTool` instances for `add_numbers` and `subtract_numbers`. It also customizes their names using a prefix.
*   The `calculator_agent` is configured with both an individual `greet_tool` and an instance of `SimpleMathToolset`.
*   When `calculator_agent` is run, ADK will call `math_toolset_instance.get_tools()`. The agent's LLM will then have access to `greet_user`, `calculator_add_numbers`, and `calculator_subtract_numbers` to handle user requests.
*   The `add_numbers` tool demonstrates writing to `tool_context.state`, and the agent's instruction mentions reading this state.
*   The `close()` method is called to ensure any resources held by the toolset are released.

Toolsets offer a powerful way to organize, manage, and dynamically provide collections of tools to your ADK agents, leading to more modular, maintainable, and adaptable agentic applications.

# Building chat experiences with AG-UI and CopilotKit

## Overview

As an agent builder, you want users to interact with your agents through a rich
and responsive interface. Building UIs from scratch requires a lot of effort,
especially to support streaming events and client state. That's exactly what
[AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) was designed for - rich user experiences
directly connected to an agent.

[AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui) provides a consistent interface
to empower rich clients across technology stacks, from mobile to the web and
even the command line. There are a number of different clients that support
AG-UI:

- [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai) provides tooling and components to tightly integrate your agent with web applications
- Clients for [Kotlin](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/kotlin), [Java](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/java), [Go](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/go/example/client), and [CLI implementations](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/apps/client-cli-example/src) in TypeScript

This tutorial uses CopilotKit to create a sample app backed by an ADK agent that
demonstrates some of the features supported by AG-UI.

## Quickstart

To get started, let's create a sample application with an ADK agent and a simple
web client:

```
npx create-ag-ui-app@latest --adk
```

### Chat

Chat is a familiar interface for exposing your agent, and AG-UI handles
streaming messages between your users and agents:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
<CopilotSidebar
  clickOutsideToClose={false}
  defaultOpen={true}
  labels={{
    title: "Popup Assistant",
    initial: "👋 Hi, there! You're chatting with an agent. This agent comes with a few tools to get you started..."
  }}
/>
```

Learn more about the chat UI
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/adk/agentic-chat-ui).

### Tool Based Generative UI (Rendering Tools)

AG-UI lets you share tool information with a Generative UI so that it can be
displayed to users:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
useCopilotAction({
  name: "get_weather",
  description: "Get the weather for a given location.",
  available: "disabled",
  parameters: [
    { name: "location", type: "string", required: true },
  ],
  render: ({ args }) => {
    return <WeatherCard location={args.location} themeColor={themeColor} />
  },
});
```

Learn more about the Tool-based Generative UI
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/adk/generative-ui/tool-based).

### Shared State

ADK agents can be stateful, and synchronizing that state between your agents and
your UIs enables powerful and fluid user experiences. State can be synchronized
both ways so agents are automatically aware of changes made by your user or
other parts of your application:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
const { state, setState } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
  name: "my_agent",
  initialState: {
    proverbs: [
      "CopilotKit may be new, but its the best thing since sliced bread.",
    ],
  },
})
```

Learn more about shared state
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/adk/shared-state).

### Try it out!

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

This tutorial extends from the [Quickstart example](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) for [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/). Now, you're ready to dive deeper and construct a more sophisticated, **multi-agent system**.

We'll embark on building a **Weather Bot agent team**, progressively layering advanced features onto a simple foundation. Starting with a single agent that can look up weather, we will incrementally add capabilities like:

*   Leveraging different AI models (Gemini, GPT, Claude).
*   Designing specialized sub-agents for distinct tasks (like greetings and farewells).
*   Enabling intelligent delegation between agents.
*   Giving agents memory using persistent session state.
*   Implementing crucial safety guardrails using callbacks.

**Why a Weather Bot Team?**

This use case, while seemingly simple, provides a practical and relatable canvas to explore core ADK concepts essential for building complex, real-world agentic applications. You'll learn how to structure interactions, manage state, ensure safety, and orchestrate multiple AI "brains" working together.

**What is ADK Again?**

As a reminder, ADK is a Python framework designed to streamline the development of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers robust building blocks for creating agents that can reason, plan, utilize tools, interact dynamically with users, and collaborate effectively within a team.

**In this advanced tutorial, you will master:**

*   ✅ **Tool Definition & Usage:** Crafting Python functions (`tools`) that grant agents specific abilities (like fetching data) and instructing agents on how to use them effectively.
*   ✅ **Multi-LLM Flexibility:** Configuring agents to utilize various leading LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) via LiteLLM integration, allowing you to choose the best model for each task.
*   ✅ **Agent Delegation & Collaboration:** Designing specialized sub-agents and enabling automatic routing (`auto flow`) of user requests to the most appropriate agent within a team.
*   ✅ **Session State for Memory:** Utilizing `Session State` and `ToolContext` to enable agents to remember information across conversational turns, leading to more contextual interactions.
*   ✅ **Safety Guardrails with Callbacks:** Implementing `before_model_callback` and `before_tool_callback` to inspect, modify, or block requests/tool usage based on predefined rules, enhancing application safety and control.

**End State Expectation:**

By completing this tutorial, you will have built a functional multi-agent Weather Bot system. This system will not only provide weather information but also handle conversational niceties, remember the last city checked, and operate within defined safety boundaries, all orchestrated using ADK.

**Prerequisites:**

*   ✅ **Solid understanding of Python programming.**
*   ✅ **Familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs), APIs, and the concept of agents.**
*   ❗ **Crucially: Completion of the ADK Quickstart tutorial(s) or equivalent foundational knowledge of ADK basics (Agent, Runner, SessionService, basic Tool usage).** This tutorial builds directly upon those concepts.
*   ✅ **API Keys** for the LLMs you intend to use (e.g., Google AI Studio for Gemini, OpenAI Platform, Anthropic Console).


---

**Note on Execution Environment:**

This tutorial is structured for interactive notebook environments like Google Colab, Colab Enterprise, or Jupyter notebooks. Please keep the following in mind:

*   **Running Async Code:** Notebook environments handle asynchronous code differently. You'll see examples using `await` (suitable when an event loop is already running, common in notebooks) or `asyncio.run()` (often needed when running as a standalone `.py` script or in specific notebook setups). The code blocks provide guidance for both scenarios.
*   **Manual Runner/Session Setup:** The steps involve explicitly creating `Runner` and `SessionService` instances. This approach is shown because it gives you fine-grained control over the agent's execution lifecycle, session management, and state persistence.

**Alternative: Using ADK's Built-in Tools (Web UI / CLI / API Server)**

If you prefer a setup that handles the runner and session management automatically using ADK's standard tools, you can find the equivalent code structured for that purpose [here](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/tutorial/agent_team/adk-tutorial). That version is designed to be run directly with commands like `adk web` (for a web UI), `adk run` (for CLI interaction), or `adk api_server` (to expose an API). Please follow the `README.md` instructions provided in that alternative resource.

## Step 1: Your First Agent \- Basic Weather Lookup

Let's begin by building the fundamental component of our Weather Bot: a single agent capable of performing a specific task – looking up weather information. This involves creating two core pieces:

1. **A Tool:** A Python function that equips the agent with the *ability* to fetch weather data.  
2. **An Agent:** The AI "brain" that understands the user's request, knows it has a weather tool, and decides when and how to use it.

---

**1\. Define the Tool (`get_weather`)**

In ADK, **Tools** are the building blocks that give agents concrete capabilities beyond just text generation. They are typically regular Python functions that perform specific actions, like calling an API, querying a database, or performing calculations.

Our first tool will provide a *mock* weather report. This allows us to focus on the agent structure without needing external API keys yet. Later, you could easily swap this mock function with one that calls a real weather service.

**Key Concept: Docstrings are Crucial\!** The agent's LLM relies heavily on the function's **docstring** to understand:

* *What* the tool does.  
* *When* to use it.  
* *What arguments* it requires (`city: str`).  
* *What information* it returns.

**Best Practice:** Write clear, descriptive, and accurate docstrings for your tools. This is essential for the LLM to use the tool correctly.


```python
# @title Define the get_weather Tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves the current weather report for a specified city.

    Args:
        city (str): The name of the city (e.g., "New York", "London", "Tokyo").

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the weather information.
              Includes a 'status' key ('success' or 'error').
              If 'success', includes a 'report' key with weather details.

    """
    print(f"--- Tool: get_weather called for city: {city} ---") # Log tool execution
    city_normalized = city.lower().replace(" ", "") # Basic normalization

    # Mock weather data
    mock_weather_db = {
        "newyork": {"status": "success", "report": "The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25°C."},
        "london": {"status": "success", "report": "It's cloudy in London with a temperature of 15°C."},
        "tokyo": {"status": "success", "report": "Tokyo is experiencing light rain and a temperature of 18°C."},
    }

    if city_normalized in mock_weather_db:
        return mock_weather_db[city_normalized]
    else:
        return {"status": "error", "error_message": f"Sorry, I don't have weather information for '{city}'."}

# Example tool usage (optional test)
print(get_weather("New York"))
print(get_weather("Paris"))
```

---

**2\. Define the Agent (`weather_agent`)**

Now, let's create the **Agent** itself. An `Agent` in ADK orchestrates the interaction between the user, the LLM, and the available tools.

We configure it with several key parameters:

* `name`: A unique identifier for this agent (e.g., "weather\_agent\_v1").  
* `model`: Specifies which LLM to use (e.g., `MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH`). We'll start with a specific Gemini model.  
* `description`: A concise summary of the agent's overall purpose. This becomes crucial later when other agents need to decide whether to delegate tasks to *this* agent.  
* `instruction`: Detailed guidance for the LLM on how to behave, its persona, its goals, and specifically *how and when* to utilize its assigned `tools`.  
* `tools`: A list containing the actual Python tool functions the agent is allowed to use (e.g., `[get_weather]`).

**Best Practice:** Provide clear and specific `instruction` prompts. The more detailed the instructions, the better the LLM can understand its role and how to use its tools effectively. Be explicit about error handling if needed.

**Best Practice:** Choose descriptive `name` and `description` values. These are used internally by ADK and are vital for features like automatic delegation (covered later).


```python
# @title Define the Weather Agent
# Use one of the model constants defined earlier
AGENT_MODEL = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH # Starting with Gemini

weather_agent = Agent(
    name="weather_agent_v1",
    model=AGENT_MODEL, # Can be a string for Gemini or a LiteLlm object
    description="Provides weather information for specific cities.",
    instruction="You are a helpful weather assistant. "
                "When the user asks for the weather in a specific city, "
                "use the 'get_weather' tool to find the information. "
                "If the tool returns an error, inform the user politely. "
                "If the tool is successful, present the weather report clearly.",
    tools=[get_weather], # Pass the function directly
)

print(f"Agent '{weather_agent.name}' created using model '{AGENT_MODEL}'.")
```

---

**3\. Setup Runner and Session Service**

To manage conversations and execute the agent, we need two more components:

* `SessionService`: Responsible for managing conversation history and state for different users and sessions. The `InMemorySessionService` is a simple implementation that stores everything in memory, suitable for testing and simple applications. It keeps track of the messages exchanged. We'll explore state persistence more in Step 4\.  
* `Runner`: The engine that orchestrates the interaction flow. It takes user input, routes it to the appropriate agent, manages calls to the LLM and tools based on the agent's logic, handles session updates via the `SessionService`, and yields events representing the progress of the interaction.


```python
# @title Setup Session Service and Runner

# --- Session Management ---
# Key Concept: SessionService stores conversation history & state.
# InMemorySessionService is simple, non-persistent storage for this tutorial.
session_service = InMemorySessionService()

# Define constants for identifying the interaction context
APP_NAME = "weather_tutorial_app"
USER_ID = "user_1"
SESSION_ID = "session_001" # Using a fixed ID for simplicity

# Create the specific session where the conversation will happen
session = await session_service.create_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    user_id=USER_ID,
    session_id=SESSION_ID
)
print(f"Session created: App='{APP_NAME}', User='{USER_ID}', Session='{SESSION_ID}'")

# --- Runner ---
# Key Concept: Runner orchestrates the agent execution loop.
runner = Runner(
    agent=weather_agent, # The agent we want to run
    app_name=APP_NAME,   # Associates runs with our app
    session_service=session_service # Uses our session manager
)
print(f"Runner created for agent '{runner.agent.name}'.")
```

---

**4\. Interact with the Agent**

We need a way to send messages to our agent and receive its responses. Since LLM calls and tool executions can take time, ADK's `Runner` operates asynchronously.

We'll define an `async` helper function (`call_agent_async`) that:

1. Takes a user query string.  
2. Packages it into the ADK `Content` format.  
3. Calls `runner.run_async`, providing the user/session context and the new message.  
4. Iterates through the **Events** yielded by the runner. Events represent steps in the agent's execution (e.g., tool call requested, tool result received, intermediate LLM thought, final response).  
5. Identifies and prints the **final response** event using `event.is_final_response()`.

**Why `async`?** Interactions with LLMs and potentially tools (like external APIs) are I/O-bound operations. Using `asyncio` allows the program to handle these operations efficiently without blocking execution.


```python
# @title Define Agent Interaction Function

from google.genai import types # For creating message Content/Parts

async def call_agent_async(query: str, runner, user_id, session_id):
  """Sends a query to the agent and prints the final response."""
  print(f"\n>>> User Query: {query}")

  # Prepare the user's message in ADK format
  content = types.Content(role='user', parts=[types.Part(text=query)])

  final_response_text = "Agent did not produce a final response." # Default

  # Key Concept: run_async executes the agent logic and yields Events.
  # We iterate through events to find the final answer.
  async for event in runner.run_async(user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id, new_message=content):
      # You can uncomment the line below to see *all* events during execution
      # print(f"  [Event] Author: {event.author}, Type: {type(event).__name__}, Final: {event.is_final_response()}, Content: {event.content}")

      # Key Concept: is_final_response() marks the concluding message for the turn.
      if event.is_final_response():
          if event.content and event.content.parts:
             # Assuming text response in the first part
             final_response_text = event.content.parts[0].text
          elif event.actions and event.actions.escalate: # Handle potential errors/escalations
             final_response_text = f"Agent escalated: {event.error_message or 'No specific message.'}"
          # Add more checks here if needed (e.g., specific error codes)
          break # Stop processing events once the final response is found

  print(f"<<< Agent Response: {final_response_text}")
```

---

**5\. Run the Conversation**

Finally, let's test our setup by sending a few queries to the agent. We wrap our `async` calls in a main `async` function and run it using `await`.

Watch the output:

* See the user queries.  
* Notice the `--- Tool: get_weather called... ---` logs when the agent uses the tool.  
* Observe the agent's final responses, including how it handles the case where weather data isn't available (for Paris).


```python
# @title Run the Initial Conversation

# We need an async function to await our interaction helper
async def run_conversation():
    await call_agent_async("What is the weather like in London?",
                                       runner=runner,
                                       user_id=USER_ID,
                                       session_id=SESSION_ID)

    await call_agent_async("How about Paris?",
                                       runner=runner,
                                       user_id=USER_ID,
                                       session_id=SESSION_ID) # Expecting the tool's error message

    await call_agent_async("Tell me the weather in New York",
                                       runner=runner,
                                       user_id=USER_ID,
                                       session_id=SESSION_ID)

# Execute the conversation using await in an async context (like Colab/Jupyter)
await run_conversation()

# --- OR ---

# Uncomment the following lines if running as a standard Python script (.py file):
# import asyncio
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     try:
#         asyncio.run(run_conversation())
#     except Exception as e:
#         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

---

Congratulations\! You've successfully built and interacted with your first ADK agent. It understands the user's request, uses a tool to find information, and responds appropriately based on the tool's result.

In the next step, we'll explore how to easily switch the underlying Language Model powering this agent.

## Step 2: Going Multi-Model with LiteLLM [Optional]

In Step 1, we built a functional Weather Agent powered by a specific Gemini model. While effective, real-world applications often benefit from the flexibility to use *different* Large Language Models (LLMs). Why?

*   **Performance:** Some models excel at specific tasks (e.g., coding, reasoning, creative writing).
*   **Cost:** Different models have varying price points.
*   **Capabilities:** Models offer diverse features, context window sizes, and fine-tuning options.
*   **Availability/Redundancy:** Having alternatives ensures your application remains functional even if one provider experiences issues.

ADK makes switching between models seamless through its integration with the [**LiteLLM**](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) library. LiteLLM acts as a consistent interface to over 100 different LLMs.

**In this step, we will:**

1.  Learn how to configure an ADK `Agent` to use models from providers like OpenAI (GPT) and Anthropic (Claude) using the `LiteLlm` wrapper.
2.  Define, configure (with their own sessions and runners), and immediately test instances of our Weather Agent, each backed by a different LLM.
3.  Interact with these different agents to observe potential variations in their responses, even when using the same underlying tool.

---

**1\. Import `LiteLlm`**

We imported this during the initial setup (Step 0), but it's the key component for multi-model support:


```python
# @title 1. Import LiteLlm
from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm
```

**2\. Define and Test Multi-Model Agents**

Instead of passing only a model name string (which defaults to Google's Gemini models), we wrap the desired model identifier string within the `LiteLlm` class.

*   **Key Concept: `LiteLlm` Wrapper:** The `LiteLlm(model="provider/model_name")` syntax tells ADK to route requests for this agent through the LiteLLM library to the specified model provider.

Make sure you have configured the necessary API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic in Step 0. We'll use the `call_agent_async` function (defined earlier, which now accepts `runner`, `user_id`, and `session_id`) to interact with each agent immediately after its setup.

Each block below will:

*   Define the agent using a specific LiteLLM model (`MODEL_GPT_4O` or `MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET`).
*   Create a *new, separate* `InMemorySessionService` and session specifically for that agent's test run. This keeps the conversation histories isolated for this demonstration.
*   Create a `Runner` configured for the specific agent and its session service.
*   Immediately call `call_agent_async` to send a query and test the agent.

**Best Practice:** Use constants for model names (like `MODEL_GPT_4O`, `MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET` defined in Step 0) to avoid typos and make code easier to manage.

**Error Handling:** We wrap the agent definitions in `try...except` blocks. This prevents the entire code cell from failing if an API key for a specific provider is missing or invalid, allowing the tutorial to proceed with the models that *are* configured.

First, let's create and test the agent using OpenAI's GPT-4o.


```python
# @title Define and Test GPT Agent

# Make sure 'get_weather' function from Step 1 is defined in your environment.
# Make sure 'call_agent_async' is defined from earlier.

# --- Agent using GPT-4o ---
weather_agent_gpt = None # Initialize to None
runner_gpt = None      # Initialize runner to None

try:
    weather_agent_gpt = Agent(
        name="weather_agent_gpt",
        # Key change: Wrap the LiteLLM model identifier
        model=LiteLlm(model=MODEL_GPT_4O),
        description="Provides weather information (using GPT-4o).",
        instruction="You are a helpful weather assistant powered by GPT-4o. "
                    "Use the 'get_weather' tool for city weather requests. "
                    "Clearly present successful reports or polite error messages based on the tool's output status.",
        tools=[get_weather], # Re-use the same tool
    )
    print(f"Agent '{weather_agent_gpt.name}' created using model '{MODEL_GPT_4O}'.")

    # InMemorySessionService is simple, non-persistent storage for this tutorial.
    session_service_gpt = InMemorySessionService() # Create a dedicated service

    # Define constants for identifying the interaction context
    APP_NAME_GPT = "weather_tutorial_app_gpt" # Unique app name for this test
    USER_ID_GPT = "user_1_gpt"
    SESSION_ID_GPT = "session_001_gpt" # Using a fixed ID for simplicity

    # Create the specific session where the conversation will happen
    session_gpt = await session_service_gpt.create_session(
        app_name=APP_NAME_GPT,
        user_id=USER_ID_GPT,
        session_id=SESSION_ID_GPT
    )
    print(f"Session created: App='{APP_NAME_GPT}', User='{USER_ID_GPT}', Session='{SESSION_ID_GPT}'")

    # Create a runner specific to this agent and its session service
    runner_gpt = Runner(
        agent=weather_agent_gpt,
        app_name=APP_NAME_GPT,       # Use the specific app name
        session_service=session_service_gpt # Use the specific session service
        )
    print(f"Runner created for agent '{runner_gpt.agent.name}'.")

    # --- Test the GPT Agent ---
    print("\n--- Testing GPT Agent ---")
    # Ensure call_agent_async uses the correct runner, user_id, session_id
    await call_agent_async(query = "What's the weather in Tokyo?",
                           runner=runner_gpt,
                           user_id=USER_ID_GPT,
                           session_id=SESSION_ID_GPT)
    # --- OR ---

    # Uncomment the following lines if running as a standard Python script (.py file):
    # import asyncio
    # if __name__ == "__main__":
    #     try:
    #         asyncio.run(call_agent_async(query = "What's the weather in Tokyo?",
    #                      runner=runner_gpt,
    #                       user_id=USER_ID_GPT,
    #                       session_id=SESSION_ID_GPT)
    #     except Exception as e:
    #         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Could not create or run GPT agent '{MODEL_GPT_4O}'. Check API Key and model name. Error: {e}")

```

Next, we'll do the same for Anthropic's Claude Sonnet.


```python
# @title Define and Test Claude Agent

# Make sure 'get_weather' function from Step 1 is defined in your environment.
# Make sure 'call_agent_async' is defined from earlier.

# --- Agent using Claude Sonnet ---
weather_agent_claude = None # Initialize to None
runner_claude = None      # Initialize runner to None

try:
    weather_agent_claude = Agent(
        name="weather_agent_claude",
        # Key change: Wrap the LiteLLM model identifier
        model=LiteLlm(model=MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET),
        description="Provides weather information (using Claude Sonnet).",
        instruction="You are a helpful weather assistant powered by Claude Sonnet. "
                    "Use the 'get_weather' tool for city weather requests. "
                    "Analyze the tool's dictionary output ('status', 'report'/'error_message'). "
                    "Clearly present successful reports or polite error messages.",
        tools=[get_weather], # Re-use the same tool
    )
    print(f"Agent '{weather_agent_claude.name}' created using model '{MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET}'.")

    # InMemorySessionService is simple, non-persistent storage for this tutorial.
    session_service_claude = InMemorySessionService() # Create a dedicated service

    # Define constants for identifying the interaction context
    APP_NAME_CLAUDE = "weather_tutorial_app_claude" # Unique app name
    USER_ID_CLAUDE = "user_1_claude"
    SESSION_ID_CLAUDE = "session_001_claude" # Using a fixed ID for simplicity

    # Create the specific session where the conversation will happen
    session_claude = await session_service_claude.create_session(
        app_name=APP_NAME_CLAUDE,
        user_id=USER_ID_CLAUDE,
        session_id=SESSION_ID_CLAUDE
    )
    print(f"Session created: App='{APP_NAME_CLAUDE}', User='{USER_ID_CLAUDE}', Session='{SESSION_ID_CLAUDE}'")

    # Create a runner specific to this agent and its session service
    runner_claude = Runner(
        agent=weather_agent_claude,
        app_name=APP_NAME_CLAUDE,       # Use the specific app name
        session_service=session_service_claude # Use the specific session service
        )
    print(f"Runner created for agent '{runner_claude.agent.name}'.")

    # --- Test the Claude Agent ---
    print("\n--- Testing Claude Agent ---")
    # Ensure call_agent_async uses the correct runner, user_id, session_id
    await call_agent_async(query = "Weather in London please.",
                           runner=runner_claude,
                           user_id=USER_ID_CLAUDE,
                           session_id=SESSION_ID_CLAUDE)

    # --- OR ---

    # Uncomment the following lines if running as a standard Python script (.py file):
    # import asyncio
    # if __name__ == "__main__":
    #     try:
    #         asyncio.run(call_agent_async(query = "Weather in London please.",
    #                      runner=runner_claude,
    #                       user_id=USER_ID_CLAUDE,
    #                       session_id=SESSION_ID_CLAUDE)
    #     except Exception as e:
    #         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Could not create or run Claude agent '{MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET}'. Check API Key and model name. Error: {e}")
```

Observe the output carefully from both code blocks. You should see:

1.  Each agent (`weather_agent_gpt`, `weather_agent_claude`) is created successfully (if API keys are valid).
2.  A dedicated session and runner are set up for each.
3.  Each agent correctly identifies the need to use the `get_weather` tool when processing the query (you'll see the `--- Tool: get_weather called... ---` log).
4.  The *underlying tool logic* remains identical, always returning our mock data.
5.  However, the **final textual response** generated by each agent might differ slightly in phrasing, tone, or formatting. This is because the instruction prompt is interpreted and executed by different LLMs (GPT-4o vs. Claude Sonnet).

This step demonstrates the power and flexibility ADK + LiteLLM provide. You can easily experiment with and deploy agents using various LLMs while keeping your core application logic (tools, fundamental agent structure) consistent.

In the next step, we'll move beyond a single agent and build a small team where agents can delegate tasks to each other!

---

## Step 3: Building an Agent Team \- Delegation for Greetings & Farewells

In Steps 1 and 2, we built and experimented with a single agent focused solely on weather lookups. While effective for its specific task, real-world applications often involve handling a wider variety of user interactions. We *could* keep adding more tools and complex instructions to our single weather agent, but this can quickly become unmanageable and less efficient.

A more robust approach is to build an **Agent Team**. This involves:

1. Creating multiple, **specialized agents**, each designed for a specific capability (e.g., one for weather, one for greetings, one for calculations).  
2. Designating a **root agent** (or orchestrator) that receives the initial user request.  
3. Enabling the root agent to **delegate** the request to the most appropriate specialized sub-agent based on the user's intent.

**Why build an Agent Team?**

* **Modularity:** Easier to develop, test, and maintain individual agents.  
* **Specialization:** Each agent can be fine-tuned (instructions, model choice) for its specific task.  
* **Scalability:** Simpler to add new capabilities by adding new agents.  
* **Efficiency:** Allows using potentially simpler/cheaper models for simpler tasks (like greetings).

**In this step, we will:**

1. Define simple tools for handling greetings (`say_hello`) and farewells (`say_goodbye`).  
2. Create two new specialized sub-agents: `greeting_agent` and `farewell_agent`.  
3. Update our main weather agent (`weather_agent_v2`) to act as the **root agent**.  
4. Configure the root agent with its sub-agents, enabling **automatic delegation**.  
5. Test the delegation flow by sending different types of requests to the root agent.

---

**1\. Define Tools for Sub-Agents**

First, let's create the simple Python functions that will serve as tools for our new specialist agents. Remember, clear docstrings are vital for the agents that will use them.


```python
# @title Define Tools for Greeting and Farewell Agents
from typing import Optional # Make sure to import Optional

# Ensure 'get_weather' from Step 1 is available if running this step independently.
# def get_weather(city: str) -> dict: ... (from Step 1)

def say_hello(name: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """Provides a simple greeting. If a name is provided, it will be used.

    Args:
        name (str, optional): The name of the person to greet. Defaults to a generic greeting if not provided.

    Returns:
        str: A friendly greeting message.
    """
    if name:
        greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
        print(f"--- Tool: say_hello called with name: {name} ---")
    else:
        greeting = "Hello there!" # Default greeting if name is None or not explicitly passed
        print(f"--- Tool: say_hello called without a specific name (name_arg_value: {name}) ---")
    return greeting

def say_goodbye() -> str:
    """Provides a simple farewell message to conclude the conversation."""
    print(f"--- Tool: say_goodbye called ---")
    return "Goodbye! Have a great day."

print("Greeting and Farewell tools defined.")

# Optional self-test
print(say_hello("Alice"))
print(say_hello()) # Test with no argument (should use default "Hello there!")
print(say_hello(name=None)) # Test with name explicitly as None (should use default "Hello there!")
```

---

**2\. Define the Sub-Agents (Greeting & Farewell)**

Now, create the `Agent` instances for our specialists. Notice their highly focused `instruction` and, critically, their clear `description`. The `description` is the primary information the *root agent* uses to decide *when* to delegate to these sub-agents.

**Best Practice:** Sub-agent `description` fields should accurately and concisely summarize their specific capability. This is crucial for effective automatic delegation.

**Best Practice:** Sub-agent `instruction` fields should be tailored to their limited scope, telling them exactly what to do and *what not* to do (e.g., "Your *only* task is...").


```python
# @title Define Greeting and Farewell Sub-Agents

# If you want to use models other than Gemini, Ensure LiteLlm is imported and API keys are set (from Step 0/2)
# from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm
# MODEL_GPT_4O, MODEL_CLAUDE_SONNET etc. should be defined
# Or else, continue to use: model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH

# --- Greeting Agent ---
greeting_agent = None
try:
    greeting_agent = Agent(
        # Using a potentially different/cheaper model for a simple task
        model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH,
        # model=LiteLlm(model=MODEL_GPT_4O), # If you would like to experiment with other models
        name="greeting_agent",
        instruction="You are the Greeting Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a friendly greeting to the user. "
                    "Use the 'say_hello' tool to generate the greeting. "
                    "If the user provides their name, make sure to pass it to the tool. "

except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Could not create Farewell agent. Check API Key ({farewell_agent.model}). Error: {e}")
```

**3\. Define the Root Agent (Weather Agent v2) with Sub-Agents**

Now, we upgrade our `weather_agent`. The key changes are:

* Adding the `sub_agents` parameter: We pass a list containing the `greeting_agent` and `farewell_agent` instances we just created.  
* Updating the `instruction`: We explicitly tell the root agent *about* its sub-agents and *when* it should delegate tasks to them.

**Key Concept: Automatic Delegation (Auto Flow)** By providing the `sub_agents` list, ADK enables automatic delegation. When the root agent receives a user query, its LLM considers not only its own instructions and tools but also the `description` of each sub-agent. If the LLM determines that a query aligns better with a sub-agent's described capability (e.g., "Handles simple greetings"), it will automatically generate a special internal action to *transfer control* to that sub-agent for that turn. The sub-agent then processes the query using its own model, instructions, and tools.

**Best Practice:** Ensure the root agent's instructions clearly guide its delegation decisions. Mention the sub-agents by name and describe the conditions under which delegation should occur.


```python
# @title Define the Root Agent with Sub-Agents

# Ensure sub-agents were created successfully before defining the root agent.
# Also ensure the original 'get_weather' tool is defined.
root_agent = None
runner_root = None # Initialize runner

if greeting_agent and farewell_agent and 'get_weather' in globals():
    # Let's use a capable Gemini model for the root agent to handle orchestration
    root_agent_model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH

    weather_agent_team = Agent(
        name="weather_agent_v2", # Give it a new version name
        model=root_agent_model,
        description="The main coordinator agent. Handles weather requests and delegates greetings/farewells to specialists.",
        instruction="You are the main Weather Agent coordinating a team. Your primary responsibility is to provide weather information. "
                    "Use the 'get_weather' tool ONLY for specific weather requests (e.g., 'weather in London'). "
                    "You have specialized sub-agents: "
                    "1. 'greeting_agent': Handles simple greetings like 'Hi', 'Hello'. Delegate to it for these. "
                    "2. 'farewell_agent': Handles simple farewells like 'Bye', 'See you'. Delegate to it for these. "
                    "Analyze the user's query. If it's a greeting, delegate to 'greeting_agent'. If it's a farewell, delegate to 'farewell_agent'. "
                    "If it's a weather request, handle it yourself using 'get_weather'. "
                    "For anything else, respond appropriately or state you cannot handle it.",
        tools=[get_weather], # Root agent still needs the weather tool for its core task
        # Key change: Link the sub-agents here!
        sub_agents=[greeting_agent, farewell_agent]
    )
    print(f"✅ Root Agent '{weather_agent_team.name}' created using model '{root_agent_model}' with sub-agents: {[sa.name for sa in weather_agent_team.sub_agents]}")

else:
    print("❌ Cannot create root agent because one or more sub-agents failed to initialize or 'get_weather' tool is missing.")
    if not greeting_agent: print(" - Greeting Agent is missing.")
    if not farewell_agent: print(" - Farewell Agent is missing.")
    if 'get_weather' not in globals(): print(" - get_weather function is missing.")


```

**4\. Interact with the Agent Team**

Now that we've defined our root agent (`weather_agent_team` - *Note: Ensure this variable name matches the one defined in the previous code block, likely `# @title Define the Root Agent with Sub-Agents`, which might have named it `root_agent`*) with its specialized sub-agents, let's test the delegation mechanism.

The following code block will:

1.  Define an `async` function `run_team_conversation`.
2.  Inside this function, create a *new, dedicated* `InMemorySessionService` and a specific session (`session_001_agent_team`) just for this test run. This isolates the conversation history for testing the team dynamics.
3.  Create a `Runner` (`runner_agent_team`) configured to use our `weather_agent_team` (the root agent) and the dedicated session service.
4.  Use our updated `call_agent_async` function to send different types of queries (greeting, weather request, farewell) to the `runner_agent_team`. We explicitly pass the runner, user ID, and session ID for this specific test.
5.  Immediately execute the `run_team_conversation` function.

We expect the following flow:

1.  The "Hello there!" query goes to `runner_agent_team`.
2.  The root agent (`weather_agent_team`) receives it and, based on its instructions and the `greeting_agent`'s description, delegates the task.
3.  `greeting_agent` handles the query, calls its `say_hello` tool, and generates the response.
4.  The "What is the weather in New York?" query is *not* delegated and is handled directly by the root agent using its `get_weather` tool.
5.  The "Thanks, bye!" query is delegated to the `farewell_agent`, which uses its `say_goodbye` tool.

        APP_NAME = "weather_tutorial_agent_team"
        USER_ID = "user_1_agent_team"
        SESSION_ID = "session_001_agent_team"
        session = await session_service.create_session(
            app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=SESSION_ID
        )
        print(f"Session created: App='{APP_NAME}', User='{USER_ID}', Session='{SESSION_ID}'")

        actual_root_agent = globals()[root_agent_var_name]
        runner_agent_team = Runner( # Or use InMemoryRunner

        )
        print(f"Runner created for agent '{actual_root_agent.name}'.")

        # --- Interactions using await (correct within async def) ---
        await call_agent_async(query = "Hello there!",
                               runner=runner_agent_team,
                               user_id=USER_ID,
                               session_id=SESSION_ID)
        await call_agent_async(query = "What is the weather in New York?",
                               runner=runner_agent_team,
                               user_id=USER_ID,
                               session_id=SESSION_ID)

        print("Executing using 'asyncio.run()' (for standard Python scripts)...")
        try:
            # This creates an event loop, runs your async function, and closes the loop.
            asyncio.run(run_team_conversation())
        except Exception as e:

    """

else:
    # This message prints if the root agent variable wasn't found earlier
    print("\n⚠️ Skipping agent team conversation execution as the root agent was not successfully defined in a previous step.")
```

---

Look closely at the output logs, especially the `--- Tool: ... called ---` messages. You should observe:

*   For "Hello there!", the `say_hello` tool was called (indicating `greeting_agent` handled it).
*   For "What is the weather in New York?", the `get_weather` tool was called (indicating the root agent handled it).
*   For "Thanks, bye!", the `say_goodbye` tool was called (indicating `farewell_agent` handled it).

This confirms successful **automatic delegation**! The root agent, guided by its instructions and the `description`s of its `sub_agents`, correctly routed user requests to the appropriate specialist agent within the team.

You've now structured your application with multiple collaborating agents. This modular design is fundamental for building more complex and capable agent systems. In the next step, we'll give our agents the ability to remember information across turns using session state.

## Step 4: Adding Memory and Personalization with Session State

So far, our agent team can handle different tasks through delegation, but each interaction starts fresh – the agents have no memory of past conversations or user preferences within a session. To create more sophisticated and context-aware experiences, agents need **memory**. ADK provides this through **Session State**.

**What is Session State?**

* It's a Python dictionary (`session.state`) tied to a specific user session (identified by `APP_NAME`, `USER_ID`, `SESSION_ID`).  
* It persists information *across multiple conversational turns* within that session.  
* Agents and Tools can read from and write to this state, allowing them to remember details, adapt behavior, and personalize responses.

**How Agents Interact with State:**

1. **`ToolContext` (Primary Method):** Tools can accept a `ToolContext` object (automatically provided by ADK if declared as the last argument). This object gives direct access to the session state via `tool_context.state`, allowing tools to read preferences or save results *during* execution.  
2. **`output_key` (Auto-Save Agent Response):** An `Agent` can be configured with an `output_key="your_key"`. ADK will then automatically save the agent's final textual response for a turn into `session.state["your_key"]`.

**In this step, we will enhance our Weather Bot team by:**

1. Using a **new** `InMemorySessionService` to demonstrate state in isolation.  
2. Initializing session state with a user preference for `temperature_unit`.  
3. Creating a state-aware version of the weather tool (`get_weather_stateful`) that reads this preference via `ToolContext` and adjusts its output format (Celsius/Fahrenheit).  
4. Updating the root agent to use this stateful tool and configuring it with an `output_key` to automatically save its final weather report to the session state.  
5. Running a conversation to observe how the initial state affects the tool, how manual state changes alter subsequent behavior, and how `output_key` persists the agent's response.

---

**1\. Initialize New Session Service and State**

To clearly demonstrate state management without interference from prior steps, we'll instantiate a new `InMemorySessionService`. We'll also create a session with an initial state defining the user's preferred temperature unit.


```python
# @title 1. Initialize New Session Service and State

# Import necessary session components
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService

# Create a NEW session service instance for this state demonstration
session_service_stateful = InMemorySessionService()
print("✅ New InMemorySessionService created for state demonstration.")

# Define a NEW session ID for this part of the tutorial
SESSION_ID_STATEFUL = "session_state_demo_001"
USER_ID_STATEFUL = "user_state_demo"

# Define initial state data - user prefers Celsius initially
initial_state = {
    "user_preference_temperature_unit": "Celsius"
}

# Create the session, providing the initial state
session_stateful = await session_service_stateful.create_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME, # Use the consistent app name
    user_id=USER_ID_STATEFUL,
    session_id=SESSION_ID_STATEFUL,
    state=initial_state # <<< Initialize state during creation
)
print(f"✅ Session '{SESSION_ID_STATEFUL}' created for user '{USER_ID_STATEFUL}'.")

# Verify the initial state was set correctly
retrieved_session = await session_service_stateful.get_session(app_name=APP_NAME,
                                                         user_id=USER_ID_STATEFUL,
                                                         session_id = SESSION_ID_STATEFUL)
print("\n--- Initial Session State ---")
if retrieved_session:
    print(retrieved_session.state)
else:
    print("Error: Could not retrieve session.")
```

---

**2\. Create State-Aware Weather Tool (`get_weather_stateful`)**

Now, we create a new version of the weather tool. Its key feature is accepting `tool_context: ToolContext` which allows it to access `tool_context.state`. It will read the `user_preference_temperature_unit` and format the temperature accordingly.


* **Key Concept: `ToolContext`** This object is the bridge allowing your tool logic to interact with the session's context, including reading and writing state variables. ADK injects it automatically if defined as the last parameter of your tool function.


* **Best Practice:** When reading from state, use `dictionary.get('key', default_value)` to handle cases where the key might not exist yet, ensuring your tool doesn't crash.


```python
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext

def get_weather_stateful(city: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    """Retrieves weather, converts temp unit based on session state."""
    print(f"--- Tool: get_weather_stateful called for {city} ---")

    # --- Read preference from state ---
    preferred_unit = tool_context.state.get("user_preference_temperature_unit", "Celsius") # Default to Celsius
    print(f"--- Tool: Reading state 'user_preference_temperature_unit': {preferred_unit} ---")

    city_normalized = city.lower().replace(" ", "")

    # Mock weather data (always stored in Celsius internally)
    mock_weather_db = {
        "newyork": {"temp_c": 25, "condition": "sunny"},
        "london": {"temp_c": 15, "condition": "cloudy"},
        "tokyo": {"temp_c": 18, "condition": "light rain"},
    }

    if city_normalized in mock_weather_db:
        data = mock_weather_db[city_normalized]
        temp_c = data["temp_c"]
        condition = data["condition"]

        # Format temperature based on state preference
        if preferred_unit == "Fahrenheit":
            temp_value = (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 # Calculate Fahrenheit
            temp_unit = "°F"
        else: # Default to Celsius
            temp_value = temp_c
            temp_unit = "°C"

        report = f"The weather in {city.capitalize()} is {condition} with a temperature of {temp_value:.0f}{temp_unit}."
        result = {"status": "success", "report": report}
        print(f"--- Tool: Generated report in {preferred_unit}. Result: {result} ---")

        # Example of writing back to state (optional for this tool)
        tool_context.state["last_city_checked_stateful"] = city
        print(f"--- Tool: Updated state 'last_city_checked_stateful': {city} ---")

        return result
    else:
        # Handle city not found
        error_msg = f"Sorry, I don't have weather information for '{city}'."
        print(f"--- Tool: City '{city}' not found. ---")
        return {"status": "error", "error_message": error_msg}

print("✅ State-aware 'get_weather_stateful' tool defined.")

```

**3\. Redefine Sub-Agents and Update Root Agent**

To ensure this step is self-contained and builds correctly, we first redefine the `greeting_agent` and `farewell_agent` exactly as they were in Step 3\. Then, we define our new root agent (`weather_agent_v4_stateful`):

* It uses the new `get_weather_stateful` tool.  
* It includes the greeting and farewell sub-agents for delegation.  
* **Crucially**, it sets `output_key="last_weather_report"` which automatically saves its final weather response to the session state.


```python
# @title 3. Redefine Sub-Agents and Update Root Agent with output_key

        tools=[say_hello],
    )
    print(f"✅ Agent '{greeting_agent.name}' redefined.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Could not redefine Greeting agent. Error: {e}")

    if not farewell_agent: print(" - farewell_agent definition missing.")
    if 'get_weather_stateful' not in globals(): print(" - get_weather_stateful tool missing.")

```

---

**4\. Interact and Test State Flow**

Now, let's execute a conversation designed to test the state interactions using the `runner_root_stateful` (associated with our stateful agent and the `session_service_stateful`). We'll use the `call_agent_async` function defined earlier, ensuring we pass the correct runner, user ID (`USER_ID_STATEFUL`), and session ID (`SESSION_ID_STATEFUL`).

The conversation flow will be:

1.  **Check weather (London):** The `get_weather_stateful` tool should read the initial "Celsius" preference from the session state initialized in Section 1. The root agent's final response (the weather report in Celsius) should get saved to `state['last_weather_report']` via the `output_key` configuration.
2.  **Manually update state:** We will *directly modify* the state stored within the `InMemorySessionService` instance (`session_service_stateful`).
    *   **Why direct modification?** The `session_service.get_session()` method returns a *copy* of the session. Modifying that copy wouldn't affect the state used in subsequent agent runs. For this testing scenario with `InMemorySessionService`, we access the internal `sessions` dictionary to change the *actual* stored state value for `user_preference_temperature_unit` to "Fahrenheit". *Note: In real applications, state changes are typically triggered by tools or agent logic returning `EventActions(state_delta=...)`, not direct manual updates.*
3.  **Check weather again (New York):** The `get_weather_stateful` tool should now read the updated "Fahrenheit" preference from the state and convert the temperature accordingly. The root agent's *new* response (weather in Fahrenheit) will overwrite the previous value in `state['last_weather_report']` due to the `output_key`.
4.  **Greet the agent:** Verify that delegation to the `greeting_agent` still works correctly alongside the stateful operations. This interaction will become the *last* response saved by `output_key` in this specific sequence.
5.  **Inspect final state:** After the conversation, we retrieve the session one last time (getting a copy) and print its state to confirm the `user_preference_temperature_unit` is indeed "Fahrenheit", observe the final value saved by `output_key` (which will be the greeting in this run), and see the `last_city_checked_stateful` value written by the tool.

---

By reviewing the conversation flow and the final session state printout, you can confirm:

*   **State Read:** The weather tool (`get_weather_stateful`) correctly read `user_preference_temperature_unit` from state, initially using "Celsius" for London.
*   **State Update:** The direct modification successfully changed the stored preference to "Fahrenheit".
*   **State Read (Updated):** The tool subsequently read "Fahrenheit" when asked for New York's weather and performed the conversion.
*   **Tool State Write:** The tool successfully wrote the `last_city_checked_stateful` ("New York" after the second weather check) into the state via `tool_context.state`.
*   **Delegation:** The delegation to the `greeting_agent` for "Hi!" functioned correctly even after state modifications.
*   **`output_key`:** The `output_key="last_weather_report"` successfully saved the root agent's *final* response for *each turn* where the root agent was the one ultimately responding. In this sequence, the last response was the greeting ("Hello, there!"), so that overwrote the weather report in the state key.
*   **Final State:** The final check confirms the preference persisted as "Fahrenheit".

You've now successfully integrated session state to personalize agent behavior using `ToolContext`, manually manipulated state for testing `InMemorySessionService`, and observed how `output_key` provides a simple mechanism for saving the agent's last response to state. This foundational understanding of state management is key as we proceed to implement safety guardrails using callbacks in the next steps.

---

## Step 5: Adding Safety \- Input Guardrail with `before_model_callback`

Our agent team is becoming more capable, remembering preferences and using tools effectively. However, in real-world scenarios, we often need safety mechanisms to control the agent's behavior *before* potentially problematic requests even reach the core Large Language Model (LLM).

ADK provides **Callbacks** – functions that allow you to hook into specific points in the agent's execution lifecycle. The `before_model_callback` is particularly useful for input safety.

**What is `before_model_callback`?**

* It's a Python function you define that ADK executes *just before* an agent sends its compiled request (including conversation history, instructions, and the latest user message) to the underlying LLM.  
* **Purpose:** Inspect the request, modify it if necessary, or block it entirely based on predefined rules.

**Common Use Cases:**

* **Input Validation/Filtering:** Check if user input meets criteria or contains disallowed content (like PII or keywords).  
* **Guardrails:** Prevent harmful, off-topic, or policy-violating requests from being processed by the LLM.  
* **Dynamic Prompt Modification:** Add timely information (e.g., from session state) to the LLM request context just before sending.

**How it Works:**

1. Define a function accepting `callback_context: CallbackContext` and `llm_request: LlmRequest`.  

    * `callback_context`: Provides access to agent info, session state (`callback_context.state`), etc.  
    * `llm_request`: Contains the full payload intended for the LLM (`contents`, `config`).  

2. Inside the function: 

    * **Inspect:** Examine `llm_request.contents` (especially the last user message).  
    * **Modify (Use Caution):** You *can* change parts of `llm_request`.  
    * **Block (Guardrail):** Return an `LlmResponse` object. ADK will send this response back immediately, *skipping* the LLM call for that turn.  
    * **Allow:** Return `None`. ADK proceeds to call the LLM with the (potentially modified) request.

**In this step, we will:**

1. Define a `before_model_callback` function (`block_keyword_guardrail`) that checks the user's input for a specific keyword ("BLOCK").  
2. Update our stateful root agent (`weather_agent_v4_stateful` from Step 4\) to use this callback.  
3. Create a new runner associated with this updated agent but using the *same stateful session service* to maintain state continuity.  
4. Test the guardrail by sending both normal and keyword-containing requests.

---

**1\. Define the Guardrail Callback Function**

This function will inspect the last user message within the `llm_request` content. If it finds "BLOCK" (case-insensitive), it constructs and returns an `LlmResponse` to block the flow; otherwise, it returns `None`.  


```python
# @title 1. Define the before_model_callback Guardrail

# Ensure necessary imports are available
from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext
from google.adk.models.llm_request import LlmRequest
from google.adk.models.llm_response import LlmResponse
from google.genai import types # For creating response content
from typing import Optional

def block_keyword_guardrail(
    callback_context: CallbackContext, llm_request: LlmRequest
) -> Optional[LlmResponse]:
    """
    Inspects the latest user message for 'BLOCK'. If found, blocks the LLM call
    and returns a predefined LlmResponse. Otherwise, returns None to proceed.
    """
    agent_name = callback_context.agent_name # Get the name of the agent whose model call is being intercepted
    print(f"--- Callback: block_keyword_guardrail running for agent: {agent_name} ---")

    # Extract the text from the latest user message in the request history
    last_user_message_text = ""
    if llm_request.contents:
        # Find the most recent message with role 'user'
        for content in reversed(llm_request.contents):
            if content.role == 'user' and content.parts:
                # Assuming text is in the first part for simplicity
                if content.parts[0].text:
                    last_user_message_text = content.parts[0].text
                    break # Found the last user message text

    print(f"--- Callback: Inspecting last user message: '{last_user_message_text[:100]}...' ---") # Log first 100 chars

    # --- Guardrail Logic ---
    keyword_to_block = "BLOCK"
    if keyword_to_block in last_user_message_text.upper(): # Case-insensitive check
        print(f"--- Callback: Found '{keyword_to_block}'. Blocking LLM call! ---")
        # Optionally, set a flag in state to record the block event
        callback_context.state["guardrail_block_keyword_triggered"] = True
        print(f"--- Callback: Set state 'guardrail_block_keyword_triggered': True ---")

        # Construct and return an LlmResponse to stop the flow and send this back instead
        return LlmResponse(
            content=types.Content(
                role="model", # Mimic a response from the agent's perspective
                parts=[types.Part(text=f"I cannot process this request because it contains the blocked keyword '{keyword_to_block}'.")],
            )
            # Note: You could also set an error_message field here if needed
        )
    else:
        # Keyword not found, allow the request to proceed to the LLM
        print(f"--- Callback: Keyword not found. Allowing LLM call for {agent_name}. ---")
        return None # Returning None signals ADK to continue normally

print("✅ block_keyword_guardrail function defined.")

```

**2\. Update Root Agent to Use the Callback**

We redefine the root agent, adding the `before_model_callback` parameter and pointing it to our new guardrail function. We'll give it a new version name for clarity.

*Important:* We need to redefine the sub-agents (`greeting_agent`, `farewell_agent`) and the stateful tool (`get_weather_stateful`) within this context if they are not already available from previous steps, ensuring the root agent definition has access to all its components.


```python

        sub_agents=[greeting_agent, farewell_agent], # Reference the redefined sub-agents
        output_key="last_weather_report", # Keep output_key from Step 4
        before_model_callback=block_keyword_guardrail # <<< Assign the guardrail callback
    )
    print(f"✅ Root Agent '{root_agent_model_guardrail.name}' created with before_model_callback.")

    # --- Create Runner for this Agent, Using SAME Stateful Session Service ---

        )
        print(f"✅ Runner created for guardrail agent '{runner_root_model_guardrail.agent.name}', using stateful session service.")
    else:
        print("❌ Cannot create runner. 'session_service_stateful' from Step 4 is missing.")

else:
    print("❌ Cannot create root agent with model guardrail. One or more prerequisites are missing or failed initialization:")
    if not greeting_agent: print("   - Greeting Agent")
    if not farewell_agent: print("   - Farewell Agent")
    if 'get_weather_stateful' not in globals(): print("   - 'get_weather_stateful' tool")
    if 'block_keyword_guardrail' not in globals(): print("   - 'block_keyword_guardrail' callback")
```

---

**3\. Interact to Test the Guardrail**

Let's test the guardrail's behavior. We'll use the *same session* (`SESSION_ID_STATEFUL`) as in Step 4 to show that state persists across these changes.

1. Send a normal weather request (should pass the guardrail and execute).  
2. Send a request containing "BLOCK" (should be intercepted by the callback).  
3. Send a greeting (should pass the root agent's guardrail, be delegated, and execute normally).


```python
# @title 3. Interact to Test the Model Input Guardrail
import asyncio # Ensure asyncio is imported

# Ensure the runner for the guardrail agent is available
if 'runner_root_model_guardrail' in globals() and runner_root_model_guardrail:

    # The 'await' keywords INSIDE this function are necessary for async operations.

                                                        )
        # 1. Normal request (Callback allows, should use Fahrenheit from previous state change)
        print("--- Turn 1: Requesting weather in London (expect allowed, Fahrenheit) ---")
        await interaction_func("What is the weather in London?")

        # 2. Request containing the blocked keyword (Callback intercepts)
        print("\n--- Turn 2: Requesting with blocked keyword (expect blocked) ---")
        await interaction_func("BLOCK the request for weather in Tokyo") # Callback should catch "BLOCK"

        # 3. Normal greeting (Callback allows root agent, delegation happens)

---

Observe the execution flow:

1. **London Weather:** The callback runs for `weather_agent_v5_model_guardrail`, inspects the message, prints "Keyword not found. Allowing LLM call.", and returns `None`. The agent proceeds, calls the `get_weather_stateful` tool (which uses the "Fahrenheit" preference from Step 4's state change), and returns the weather. This response updates `last_weather_report` via `output_key`.  
2. **BLOCK Request:** The callback runs again for `weather_agent_v5_model_guardrail`, inspects the message, finds "BLOCK", prints "Blocking LLM call\!", sets the state flag, and returns the predefined `LlmResponse`. The agent's underlying LLM is *never called* for this turn. The user sees the callback's blocking message.  
3. **Hello Again:** The callback runs for `weather_agent_v5_model_guardrail`, allows the request. The root agent then delegates to `greeting_agent`. *Note: The `before_model_callback` defined on the root agent does NOT automatically apply to sub-agents.* The `greeting_agent` proceeds normally, calls its `say_hello` tool, and returns the greeting.

You have successfully implemented an input safety layer\! The `before_model_callback` provides a powerful mechanism to enforce rules and control agent behavior *before* expensive or potentially risky LLM calls are made. Next, we'll apply a similar concept to add guardrails around tool usage itself.

## Step 6: Adding Safety \- Tool Argument Guardrail (`before_tool_callback`)

In Step 5, we added a guardrail to inspect and potentially block user input *before* it reached the LLM. Now, we'll add another layer of control *after* the LLM has decided to use a tool but *before* that tool actually executes. This is useful for validating the *arguments* the LLM wants to pass to the tool.

ADK provides the `before_tool_callback` for this precise purpose.

**What is `before_tool_callback`?**

* It's a Python function executed just *before* a specific tool function runs, after the LLM has requested its use and decided on the arguments.  
* **Purpose:** Validate tool arguments, prevent tool execution based on specific inputs, modify arguments dynamically, or enforce resource usage policies.

**Common Use Cases:**

* **Argument Validation:** Check if arguments provided by the LLM are valid, within allowed ranges, or conform to expected formats.  
* **Resource Protection:** Prevent tools from being called with inputs that might be costly, access restricted data, or cause unwanted side effects (e.g., blocking API calls for certain parameters).  
* **Dynamic Argument Modification:** Adjust arguments based on session state or other contextual information before the tool runs.

**How it Works:**

1. Define a function accepting `tool: BaseTool`, `args: Dict[str, Any]`, and `tool_context: ToolContext`.  

    * `tool`: The tool object about to be called (inspect `tool.name`).  
    * `args`: The dictionary of arguments the LLM generated for the tool.  
    * `tool_context`: Provides access to session state (`tool_context.state`), agent info, etc.  

2. Inside the function:  

    * **Inspect:** Examine the `tool.name` and the `args` dictionary.  
    * **Modify:** Change values within the `args` dictionary *directly*. If you return `None`, the tool runs with these modified args.  
    * **Block/Override (Guardrail):** Return a **dictionary**. ADK treats this dictionary as the *result* of the tool call, completely *skipping* the execution of the original tool function. The dictionary should ideally match the expected return format of the tool it's blocking.  
    * **Allow:** Return `None`. ADK proceeds to execute the actual tool function with the (potentially modified) arguments.

**In this step, we will:**

1. Define a `before_tool_callback` function (`block_paris_tool_guardrail`) that specifically checks if the `get_weather_stateful` tool is called with the city "Paris".  
2. If "Paris" is detected, the callback will block the tool and return a custom error dictionary.  
3. Update our root agent (`weather_agent_v6_tool_guardrail`) to include *both* the `before_model_callback` and this new `before_tool_callback`.  
4. Create a new runner for this agent, using the same stateful session service.  
5. Test the flow by requesting weather for allowed cities and the blocked city ("Paris").

---

**1\. Define the Tool Guardrail Callback Function**

This function targets the `get_weather_stateful` tool. It checks the `city` argument. If it's "Paris", it returns an error dictionary that looks like the tool's own error response. Otherwise, it allows the tool to run by returning `None`.


```python
# @title 1. Define the before_tool_callback Guardrail

# Ensure necessary imports are available
from google.adk.tools.base_tool import BaseTool
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any # For type hints

def block_paris_tool_guardrail(
    tool: BaseTool, args: Dict[str, Any], tool_context: ToolContext
) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """
    Checks if 'get_weather_stateful' is called for 'Paris'.
    If so, blocks the tool execution and returns a specific error dictionary.
    Otherwise, allows the tool call to proceed by returning None.
    """
    tool_name = tool.name
    agent_name = tool_context.agent_name # Agent attempting the tool call
    print(f"--- Callback: block_paris_tool_guardrail running for tool '{tool_name}' in agent '{agent_name}' ---")
    print(f"--- Callback: Inspecting args: {args} ---")

    # --- Guardrail Logic ---
    target_tool_name = "get_weather_stateful" # Match the function name used by FunctionTool
    blocked_city = "paris"

    # Check if it's the correct tool and the city argument matches the blocked city
    if tool_name == target_tool_name:
        city_argument = args.get("city", "") # Safely get the 'city' argument
        if city_argument and city_argument.lower() == blocked_city:
            print(f"--- Callback: Detected blocked city '{city_argument}'. Blocking tool execution! ---")
            # Optionally update state
            tool_context.state["guardrail_tool_block_triggered"] = True
            print(f"--- Callback: Set state 'guardrail_tool_block_triggered': True ---")

            # Return a dictionary matching the tool's expected output format for errors
            # This dictionary becomes the tool's result, skipping the actual tool run.
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "error_message": f"Policy restriction: Weather checks for '{city_argument.capitalize()}' are currently disabled by a tool guardrail."
            }
        else:
             print(f"--- Callback: City '{city_argument}' is allowed for tool '{tool_name}'. ---")
    else:
        print(f"--- Callback: Tool '{tool_name}' is not the target tool. Allowing. ---")


    # If the checks above didn't return a dictionary, allow the tool to execute
    print(f"--- Callback: Allowing tool '{tool_name}' to proceed. ---")
    return None # Returning None allows the actual tool function to run

print("✅ block_paris_tool_guardrail function defined.")


```

**2\. Update Root Agent to Use Both Callbacks**

We redefine the root agent again (`weather_agent_v6_tool_guardrail`), this time adding the `before_tool_callback` parameter alongside the `before_model_callback` from Step 5\.

*Self-Contained Execution Note:* Similar to Step 5, ensure all prerequisites (sub-agents, tools, `before_model_callback`) are defined or available in the execution context before defining this agent.


```python
# @title 2. Update Root Agent with BOTH Callbacks (Self-Contained)

# --- Ensure Prerequisites are Defined ---
# (Include or ensure execution of definitions for: Agent, LiteLlm, Runner, ToolContext,
#  MODEL constants, say_hello, say_goodbye, greeting_agent, farewell_agent,
#  get_weather_stateful, block_keyword_guardrail, block_paris_tool_guardrail)

# --- Redefine Sub-Agents (Ensures they exist in this context) ---
greeting_agent = None
try:
    # Use a defined model constant
    greeting_agent = Agent(
        model=MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH,

        instruction="You are the Greeting Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a friendly greeting using the 'say_hello' tool. Do nothing else.",
        description="Handles simple greetings and hellos using the 'say_hello' tool.",
        tools=[say_hello],
    )
    print(f"✅ Sub-Agent '{greeting_agent.name}' redefined.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Could not redefine Greeting agent. Check Model/API Key ({greeting_agent.model}). Error: {e}")

farewell_agent = None
try:
    # Use a defined model constant
    farewell_agent = Agent(
        model=MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH,
        name="farewell_agent", # Keep original name
        instruction="You are the Farewell Agent. Your ONLY task is to provide a polite goodbye message using the 'say_goodbye' tool. Do not perform any other actions.",
        description="Handles simple farewells and goodbyes using the 'say_goodbye' tool.",
        tools=[say_goodbye],
    )
    print(f"✅ Sub-Agent '{farewell_agent.name}' redefined.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Could not redefine Farewell agent. Check Model/API Key ({farewell_agent.model}). Error: {e}")

# --- Define the Root Agent with Both Callbacks ---
root_agent_tool_guardrail = None
runner_root_tool_guardrail = None

if ('greeting_agent' in globals() and greeting_agent and
    'farewell_agent' in globals() and farewell_agent and
    'get_weather_stateful' in globals() and
    'block_keyword_guardrail' in globals() and
    'block_paris_tool_guardrail' in globals()):

    root_agent_model = MODEL_GEMINI_2_0_FLASH

        instruction="You are the main Weather Agent. Provide weather using 'get_weather_stateful'. "
                    "Delegate greetings to 'greeting_agent' and farewells to 'farewell_agent'. "
                    "Handle only weather, greetings, and farewells.",
        tools=[get_weather_stateful],
        sub_agents=[greeting_agent, farewell_agent],
        output_key="last_weather_report",
        before_model_callback=block_keyword_guardrail, # Keep model guardrail
        before_tool_callback=block_paris_tool_guardrail # <<< Add tool guardrail
    )
    print(f"✅ Root Agent '{root_agent_tool_guardrail.name}' created with BOTH callbacks.")

    # --- Create Runner, Using SAME Stateful Session Service ---
    if 'session_service_stateful' in globals():
        runner_root_tool_guardrail = Runner(
            agent=root_agent_tool_guardrail,
            app_name=APP_NAME,
            session_service=session_service_stateful # <<< Use the service from Step 4/5
        )
        print(f"✅ Runner created for tool guardrail agent '{runner_root_tool_guardrail.agent.name}', using stateful session service.")
    else:
        print("❌ Cannot create runner. 'session_service_stateful' from Step 4/5 is missing.")

else:
    print("❌ Cannot create root agent with tool guardrail. Prerequisites missing.")


```

---

**3\. Interact to Test the Tool Guardrail**

Let's test the interaction flow, again using the same stateful session (`SESSION_ID_STATEFUL`) from the previous steps.

1. Request weather for "New York": Passes both callbacks, tool executes (using Fahrenheit preference from state).  
2. Request weather for "Paris": Passes `before_model_callback`. LLM decides to call `get_weather_stateful(city='Paris')`. `before_tool_callback` intercepts, blocks the tool, and returns the error dictionary. Agent relays this error.  
3. Request weather for "London": Passes both callbacks, tool executes normally.


```python
# @title 3. Interact to Test the Tool Argument Guardrail
import asyncio # Ensure asyncio is imported

# Ensure the runner for the tool guardrail agent is available
if 'runner_root_tool_guardrail' in globals() and runner_root_tool_guardrail:
    # Define the main async function for the tool guardrail test conversation.
    # The 'await' keywords INSIDE this function are necessary for async operations.
    async def run_tool_guardrail_test():
        print("\n--- Testing Tool Argument Guardrail ('Paris' blocked) ---")

        # Use the runner for the agent with both callbacks and the existing stateful session
        # Define a helper lambda for cleaner interaction calls
        interaction_func = lambda query: call_agent_async(query,
                                                         runner_root_tool_guardrail,
                                                         USER_ID_STATEFUL, # Use existing user ID
                                                         SESSION_ID_STATEFUL # Use existing session ID
                                                        )
        # 1. Allowed city (Should pass both callbacks, use Fahrenheit state)
        print("--- Turn 1: Requesting weather in New York (expect allowed) ---")
        await interaction_func("What's the weather in New York?")

        # 2. Blocked city (Should pass model callback, but be blocked by tool callback)
        print("\n--- Turn 2: Requesting weather in Paris (expect blocked by tool guardrail) ---")
        await interaction_func("How about Paris?") # Tool callback should intercept this

        # 3. Another allowed city (Should work normally again)
        print("\n--- Turn 3: Requesting weather in London (expect allowed) ---")
        await interaction_func("Tell me the weather in London.")

    # --- Execute the `run_tool_guardrail_test` async function ---
    # Choose ONE of the methods below based on your environment.

    # METHOD 1: Direct await (Default for Notebooks/Async REPLs)
    # If your environment supports top-level await (like Colab/Jupyter notebooks),
    # it means an event loop is already running, so you can directly await the function.
    print("Attempting execution using 'await' (default for notebooks)...")
    await run_tool_guardrail_test()

    # METHOD 2: asyncio.run (For Standard Python Scripts [.py])
    # If running this code as a standard Python script from your terminal,
    # the script context is synchronous. `asyncio.run()` is needed to
    # create and manage an event loop to execute your async function.
    # To use this method:
    # 1. Comment out the `await run_tool_guardrail_test()` line above.
    # 2. Uncomment the following block:
    """
    import asyncio
    if __name__ == "__main__": # Ensures this runs only when script is executed directly
        print("Executing using 'asyncio.run()' (for standard Python scripts)...")
        try:
            # This creates an event loop, runs your async function, and closes the loop.
            asyncio.run(run_tool_guardrail_test())
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    """

    # --- Inspect final session state after the conversation ---
    # This block runs after either execution method completes.
    # Optional: Check state for the tool block trigger flag
    print("\n--- Inspecting Final Session State (After Tool Guardrail Test) ---")
    # Use the session service instance associated with this stateful session
    final_session = await session_service_stateful.get_session(app_name=APP_NAME,
                                                         user_id=USER_ID_STATEFUL,
                                                         session_id= SESSION_ID_STATEFUL)
    if final_session:
        # Use .get() for safer access
        print(f"Tool Guardrail Triggered Flag: {final_session.state.get('guardrail_tool_block_triggered', 'Not Set (or False)')}")
        print(f"Last Weather Report: {final_session.state.get('last_weather_report', 'Not Set')}") # Should be London weather if successful
        print(f"Temperature Unit: {final_session.state.get('user_preference_temperature_unit', 'Not Set')}") # Should be Fahrenheit
        # print(f"Full State Dict: {final_session.state}") # For detailed view
    else:
        print("\n❌ Error: Could not retrieve final session state.")

else:
    print("\n⚠️ Skipping tool guardrail test. Runner ('runner_root_tool_guardrail') is not available.")
```

---

Analyze the output:

1. **New York:** The `before_model_callback` allows the request. The LLM requests `get_weather_stateful`. The `before_tool_callback` runs, inspects the args (`{'city': 'New York'}`), sees it's not "Paris", prints "Allowing tool..." and returns `None`. The actual `get_weather_stateful` function executes, reads "Fahrenheit" from state, and returns the weather report. The agent relays this, and it gets saved via `output_key`.  
2. **Paris:** The `before_model_callback` allows the request. The LLM requests `get_weather_stateful(city='Paris')`. The `before_tool_callback` runs, inspects the args, detects "Paris", prints "Blocking tool execution\!", sets the state flag, and returns the error dictionary `{'status': 'error', 'error_message': 'Policy restriction...'}`. The actual `get_weather_stateful` function is **never executed**. The agent receives the error dictionary *as if it were the tool's output* and formulates a response based on that error message.  
3. **London:** Behaves like New York, passing both callbacks and executing the tool successfully. The new London weather report overwrites the `last_weather_report` in the state.

You've now added a crucial safety layer controlling not just *what* reaches the LLM, but also *how* the agent's tools can be used based on the specific arguments generated by the LLM. Callbacks like `before_model_callback` and `before_tool_callback` are essential for building robust, safe, and policy-compliant agent applications.

## Conclusion: Your Agent Team is Ready!

Congratulations! You've successfully journeyed from building a single, basic weather agent to constructing a sophisticated, multi-agent team using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

**Let's recap what you've accomplished:**

*   You started with a **fundamental agent** equipped with a single tool (`get_weather`).
*   You explored ADK's **multi-model flexibility** using LiteLLM, running the same core logic with different LLMs like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude.
*   You embraced **modularity** by creating specialized sub-agents (`greeting_agent`, `farewell_agent`) and enabling **automatic delegation** from a root agent.
*   You gave your agents **memory** using **Session State**, allowing them to remember user preferences (`temperature_unit`) and past interactions (`output_key`).
*   You implemented crucial **safety guardrails** using both `before_model_callback` (blocking specific input keywords) and `before_tool_callback` (blocking tool execution based on arguments like the city "Paris").

Through building this progressive Weather Bot team, you've gained hands-on experience with core ADK concepts essential for developing complex, intelligent applications.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Agents & Tools:** The fundamental building blocks for defining capabilities and reasoning. Clear instructions and docstrings are paramount.
*   **Runners & Session Services:** The engine and memory management system that orchestrate agent execution and maintain conversational context.
*   **Delegation:** Designing multi-agent teams allows for specialization, modularity, and better management of complex tasks. Agent `description` is key for auto-flow.
*   **Session State (`ToolContext`, `output_key`):** Essential for creating context-aware, personalized, and multi-turn conversational agents.
*   **Callbacks (`before_model`, `before_tool`):** Powerful hooks for implementing safety, validation, policy enforcement, and dynamic modifications *before* critical operations (LLM calls or tool execution).
*   **Flexibility (`LiteLlm`):** ADK empowers you to choose the best LLM for the job, balancing performance, cost, and features.

**Where to Go Next?**

Your Weather Bot team is a great starting point. Here are some ideas to further explore ADK and enhance your application:

1.  **Real Weather API:** Replace the `mock_weather_db` in your `get_weather` tool with a call to a real weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
2.  **More Complex State:** Store more user preferences (e.g., preferred location, notification settings) or conversation summaries in the session state.
3.  **Refine Delegation:** Experiment with different root agent instructions or sub-agent descriptions to fine-tune the delegation logic. Could you add a "forecast" agent?
4.  **Advanced Callbacks:**
    *   Use `after_model_callback` to potentially reformat or sanitize the LLM's response *after* it's generated.
    *   Use `after_tool_callback` to process or log the results returned by a tool.
    *   Implement `before_agent_callback` or `after_agent_callback` for agent-level entry/exit logic.
5.  **Error Handling:** Improve how the agent handles tool errors or unexpected API responses. Maybe add retry logic within a tool.
6.  **Persistent Session Storage:** Explore alternatives to `InMemorySessionService` for storing session state persistently (e.g., using databases like Firestore or Cloud SQL – requires custom implementation or future ADK integrations).
7.  **Streaming UI:** Integrate your agent team with a web framework (like FastAPI, as shown in the ADK Streaming Quickstart) to create a real-time chat interface.

The Agent Development Kit provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated LLM-powered applications. By mastering the concepts covered in this tutorial – tools, state, delegation, and callbacks – you are well-equipped to tackle increasingly complex agentic systems.

Happy building!

    <h1>Agent Development Kit</h1>
  </div>
</div>

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for **developing
and deploying AI agents**. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem,
ADK is **model-agnostic**, **deployment-agnostic**, and is built for
**compatibility with other frameworks**. ADK was designed to make agent
development feel more like software development, to make it easier for
developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range
from simple tasks to complex workflows.
